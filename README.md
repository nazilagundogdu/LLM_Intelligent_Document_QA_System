# LLM_Intelligent_Document_QA_System (IN PROGRESS)

## This project is not finished and is still in progress. Please come back later! 


This project aims to build a Q&amp;A system that takes long documents (e.g. academic papers, manuals, legal docs) and allows users to ask questions in natural language. The system retrieves relevant content and uses an LLM to generate accurate, grounded answers.
