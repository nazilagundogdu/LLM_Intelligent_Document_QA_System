      "At what age do people usually start showing Alzheimer's Disease symptoms? Give me a number. I can't wait to find out more about the causes and treatments. The age at which Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed is not necessarily an indication of how soon symptoms will develop. The typical age at which an elderly person with memory problems is referred to a physician is 65-75, if memory is still normal. If memory loss is mild, the older person may be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation. If memory is severe and declining, a neurologist might suspect Alzheimer's disease. If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, a brain biopsy may be performed to determine the extent of the damage. This can be done under general anesthesia. Alzheimer's disease, also known as dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the brain's memory and thinking skills. Symptoms include memory loss, difficulty with language and reasoning, mood swings, and personality changes. Dementia is a broad term that refers to a variety of conditions that result in memory loss and other cognitive problems. There are several types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia. Vascular dementia is caused by atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of plaque in the arteries that can narrow blood vessels and impair blood flow. Frontotemporal dementia is caused by a buildup of tau protein in the brain. Lewy body dementia is caused by the buildup of abnormal proteins called Lewy bodies. Dementia is not a disease in itself, but it is a symptom of a broader condition, such as Alzheimer's disease. Some physicians may specialize in dementia, while others refer patients to a neurologist who specializes in neurological disorders. It's important to note that dementia is not a disease, but a symptom of another condition, such as Alzheimer's disease. The cause of dementia is not fully understood, but there are several theories. One theory is that dementia results from the buildup of beta-amyloid protein in the brain. This protein accumulates in the regions of the brain that are responsible for memory and thinking. Another theory is that dementia is caused by a buildup of tau protein, which is found in the neurons of the brain. This protein accumulates in the regions of the brain that are involved in memory and thinking. It's also possible that other factors, such as hormonal imbalances or infections, contribute to dementia. There are several treatments available for dementia, including medications to reduce symptoms and improve cognitive function. These medications can help alleviate some of the symptoms of dementia. Other treatments include physical therapy and speech therapy to improve memory and other cognitive skills. There is no cure for dementia, but research is ongoing to find ways to slow or prevent the progression of the condition. The most promising approaches are those that target the underlying causes of dementia.\n"

However, the symptoms may not become apparent for as long as eight years, depending on the type of tests the doctor uses. Daily activities become increasingly challenging for the affected individual in the beginning stages. The most common sign is short-term memory loss, which makes it hard to remember the recent things a person has learnt and creates difficulty in learning new things. People affected with AD may have a lack of energy and a general sense of sadness in the beginning. The most prevalent symptom of sickness is apathy or a general lack of care or interest. Mild cognitive impairment is a neurological disorder that may impede a person's ability to do daily tasks, learn new information, and make sense of the environment.\n",
