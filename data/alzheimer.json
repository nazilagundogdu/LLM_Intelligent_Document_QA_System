        "title": "Investigating Conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's\n  Disease using Latent Space Manipulation",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia that affects\nmillions of lives worldwide. Investigating the underlying causes and risk\nfactors of Alzheimer's disease is essential to prevent its progression. Mild\nCognitive Impairment (MCI) is considered an intermediate stage before\nAlzheimer's disease. Early prediction of the conversion from the MCI to\nAlzheimer's is crucial to take necessary precautions for decelerating the\nprogression and developing suitable treatments. In this study, we propose a\ndeep learning framework to discover the variables which are identifiers of the\nconversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. In particular, the latent space of\na variational auto-encoder network trained with the MCI and Alzheimer's\npatients is manipulated to obtain the significant attributes and decipher their\nbehavior that leads to the conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. By\nutilizing a generative decoder and the dimensions that lead to the Alzheimer's\ndiagnosis, we generate synthetic dementia patients from MCI patients in the\ndataset. Experimental results show promising quantitative and qualitative\nresults on one of the most extensive and commonly used Alzheimer's disease\nneuroimaging datasets in literature.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia in the western world,\nhowever there is no cure available for this devastating neurodegenerative\ndisorder. Despite clinical and experimental evidence implicating the intestinal\nmicrobiota in a number of brain disorders, its impact on Alzheimer's disease is\nnot known. We generated a germ-free mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and\ndiscovered a drastic reduction of cerebral Ab amyloid pathology when compared\nto control Alzheimer's disease animals with intestinal microbiota. Sequencing\nbacterial 16S rRNA from fecal samples revealed a remarkable shift in the gut\nmicrobiota of conventionally-raised Alzheimer's disease mice as compared to\nhealthy, wild-type mice. Colonization of germ-free Alzheimer mice with\nharvested microbiota from conventionally-raised Alzheimer mice dramatically\nincreased cerebral Ab pathology. In contrast, colonization with microbiota from\ncontrol wild-type mice was ineffective in increasing cerebral Ab levels. Our\nresults indicate a microbial involvement in the development of Alzheimer's\ndisease pathology, and suggest that microbiota may contribute to the\ndevelopment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "summary": "Alzheimers disease is a deadly neurological condition, impairing important\nmemory and brain functions. Alzheimers disease promotes brain shrinkage,\nultimately leading to dementia. Dementia diagnosis typically takes 2.8 to 4.4\nyears after the first clinical indication. Advancements in computing and\ninformation technology have led to many techniques of studying Alzheimers\ndisease. Early identification and therapy are crucial for preventing Alzheimers\ndisease, as early-onset dementia hits people before the age of 65, while\nlate-onset dementia occurs after this age. According to the 2015 World\nAlzheimers disease Report, there are 46.8 million individuals worldwide\nsuffering from dementia, with an anticipated 74.7 million more by 2030 and\n131.5 million by 2050. Deep Learning has outperformed conventional Machine\nLearning techniques by identifying intricate structures in high-dimensional\ndata. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN),\nhave achieved an accuracy of up to 96.0% for Alzheimers disease classification,\nand 84.2% for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction. There have\nbeen few literature surveys available on applying ML to predict dementia,\nlacking in congenital observations. However, this survey has focused on a\nspecific data channel for dementia detection. This study evaluated Deep\nLearning algorithms for early Alzheimers disease detection, using openly\naccessible datasets, feature segmentation, and classification methods. This\narticle also has identified research gaps and limits in detecting Alzheimers\ndisease, which can inform future research.",

Recent studies suggest that the spatio-temporal pattern\nof misfolded tau follows a reaction-diffusion type equation. However, the\nprecise mathematical model and parameters that characterize the progression of\nmisfolded protein across the brain remain incompletely understood. Here, we use\ndeep learning and artificial intelligence to discover a mathematical model for\nthe progression of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal tau positron emission\ntomography from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database.\nSpecifically, we integrate physics informed neural networks (PINNs) and\nsymbolic regression to discover a reaction-diffusion type partial differential\nequation for tau protein misfolding and spreading. First, we demonstrate the\npotential of our model and parameter discovery on synthetic data. Then, we\napply our method to discover the best model and parameters to explain tau\nimaging data from 46 individuals who are likely to develop Alzheimer's disease\nand 30 healthy controls. Our symbolic regression discovers different misfolding\nmodels $f(c)$ for two groups, with a faster misfolding for the Alzheimer's\ngroup, $f(c) = 0.23c^3 - 1.34c^2 + 1.11c$, than for the healthy control group,\n$f(c) = -c^3 +0.62c^2 + 0.39c$. Our results suggest that PINNs, supplemented by\nsymbolic regression, can discover a reaction-diffusion type model to explain\nmisfolded tau protein concentrations in Alzheimer's disease. We expect our\nstudy to be the starting point for a more holistic analysis to provide\nimage-based technologies for early diagnosis, and ideally early treatment of\nneurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and possibly other misfolding-protein\nbased neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "summary": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is a challenge because the existing\nmethodologies do not identify the patients in their preclinical stage, which\ncan last up to a decade prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Several\nresearch studies demonstrate the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers,\namyloid beta 1-42, T-tau, and P-tau, in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease\nstages. In this work, we used machine learning models to classify different\nstages of Alzheimer's disease based on the cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels\nalone. An electronic health record of patients from the National Alzheimer's\nCoordinating Centre database was analyzed and the patients were subdivided\nbased on mini-mental state scores and clinical dementia ratings. Statistical\nand correlation analyses were performed to identify significant differences\nbetween the Alzheimer's stages. Afterward, machine learning classifiers\nincluding K-Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble Boosted Tree, Ensemble Bagged Tree,\nSupport Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes classifiers were\nemployed to classify the Alzheimer's disease stages. The results demonstrate\nthat Ensemble Boosted Tree (84.4%) and Logistic Regression (73.4%) provide the\nhighest accuracy for binary classification, while Ensemble Bagged Tree (75.4%)\ndemonstrates better accuracy for multiclassification. The findings from this\nresearch are expected to help clinicians in making an informed decision\nregarding the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's from the cerebrospinal fluid\nbiomarkers alone, monitoring of the disease progression, and implementation of\nappropriate intervention measures.",

        "summary": "Recently it was shown explicitly that free recall consists of two stages: the\nfirst few recalls empty working memory (narrowly defined) and a second stage, a\nreactivation stage, concludes the recall (Tarnow, 2015). It was also shown that\nthe serial position curve changes in mild Alzheimer's disease, lowered total\nrecall and lessened primacy, are similar to second stage recall and different\nfrom recall from working memory. The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, Tarnow,\n2013) uses double integer items to separate out only the first stage, the\nemptying of working memory, by making it difficult to reactivate items due to\nthe lack of intra-item relationships. Here it is shown that subject TUT selects\nout diagnosed Alzheimer's Disease but not MCI. On average, diagnosed\nAlzheimer's Disease is correlated with a loss of 0.7 memory slots (out of an\naverage of 2.7 slots). The identification of a lost memory slot may have\nimplications for improved stage definitions of Alzheimer's disease and for\nremediation therapy via working memory capacity management. In conjunction with\nthe Alzheimer's disease process map, it may also be useful to identify the\nexact location of working memory.",

This paper develops a novel feature selection method to\nidentify pathogenic factors of Alzheimer disease using the proteomic and\nclinical data.

        "summary": "Background: Alzheimers disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder\nand the main cause of dementia in aging. Hippocampus is prone to changes in the\nearly stages of Alzheimers disease. Detection and observation of the\nhippocampus changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the onset of\nAlzheimers disease leads to the faster preventive and therapeutic measures.\nObjective: The aim of this study was the segmentation of the hippocampus in\nmagnetic resonance (MR) images of Alzheimers patients using deep machine\nlearning method. Methods: U-Net architecture of convolutional neural network\nwas proposed to segment the hippocampus in the real MRI data. The MR images of\nthe 100 and 35 patients available in Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative\n(ADNI) dataset, was used for the train and test of the model, respectively. The\nperformance of the proposed method was compared with manual segmentation by\nmeasuring the similarity metrics. Results: The desired segmentation achieved\nafter 10 iterations. A Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 92.3%, sensitivity =\n96.5%, positive predicted value (PPV) = 90.4%, and Intersection over Union\n(IoU) value for the train 92.94 and test 92.93 sets were obtained which are\nacceptable. Conclusion: The proposed approach is promising and can be extended\nin the prognosis of Alzheimers disease by the prediction of the hippocampus\nvolume changes in the early stage of the disease.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that is one of the\nmost common forms of dementia. It leads to a decline in memory, reasoning\nability, and behavior, especially in older people. The cause of Alzheimer's\nDisease is still under exploration and there is no all-inclusive theory that\ncan explain the pathologies in each individual patient. Nevertheless, early\nintervention has been found to be effective in managing symptoms and slowing\ndown the disease's progression. Recent research has utilized\nelectroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers that distinguish\nAlzheimer's Disease patients from healthy individuals. Prior studies have used\nvarious machine learning methods, including deep learning and graph neural\nnetworks, to examine electroencephalography-based signals for identifying\nAlzheimer's Disease patients. In our research, we proposed a Flexible and\nExplainable Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) with Multi-Objective\nTree-Structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) hyperparameter tuning. This provides a\nflexible solution that efficiently identifies the optimal number of GGCN blocks\nto achieve the optimized precision, specificity, and recall outcomes, as well\nas the optimized area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC). Our\nfindings demonstrated a high efficacy with an over 0.9 Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic score, alongside precision, specificity, and recall scores in\ndistinguishing health control with Alzheimer's Disease patients in Moderate to\nSevere Dementia using the power spectrum density (PSD) of\nelectroencephalography signals across various frequency bands. Moreover, our\nresearch enhanced the interpretability of the embedded adjacency matrices,\nrevealing connectivity differences in frontal and parietal brain regions\nbetween Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals.",

Key metrics\nfrom DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable\ntransfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the\ntransformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank\nAdaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction\n(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)\nand amyloid status classification.\n  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the\nscope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of\n95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with\nAlzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it\nreached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild\ncognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from\namyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying\namyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects.

For the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, a series of scales\nare often needed to evaluate the diagnosis clinically, which not only increases\nthe workload of doctors, but also makes the results of diagnosis highly\nsubjective. Therefore, for Alzheimer's disease, imaging means to find early\ndiagnostic markers has become a top priority.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel 3DMgNet architecture which is a unified\nframework of multigrid and convolutional neural network to diagnose Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD). The model is trained using an open dataset (ADNI dataset) and\nthen test with a smaller dataset of ours. Finally, the model achieved 92.133%\naccuracy for AD vs NC classification and significantly reduced the model\nparameters.",

        "summary": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential in preventing the\ndisease's progression. Therefore, detecting AD from neuroimaging data such as\nstructural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been a topic of intense\ninvestigation in recent years. Deep learning has gained considerable attention\nin Alzheimer's detection. However, training a convolutional neural network from\nscratch is challenging since it demands more computational time and a\nsignificant amount of annotated data. By transferring knowledge learned from\nother image recognition tasks to medical image classification, transfer\nlearning can provide a promising and effective solution. Irregularities in the\ndataset distribution present another difficulty. Class decomposition can tackle\nthis issue by simplifying learning a dataset's class boundaries. Motivated by\nthese approaches, this paper proposes a transfer learning method using class\ndecomposition to detect Alzheimer's disease from sMRI images. We use two\nImageNet-trained architectures: VGG19 and ResNet50, and an entropy-based\ntechnique to determine the most informative images. The proposed model achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) vs mild cognitive\nimpairment (MCI) vs cognitively normal (CN) classification task with a 3\\%\nincrease in accuracy from what is reported in the literature.",

So that MRI is the\ntechnique most often used for the diagnosis and analysis of the progress of\nAlzheimer's disease. With this technology, image recognition in the early\ndiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be achieved automatically using machine\nlearning. Although machine learning has many advantages, currently the use of\ndeep learning is more widely applied because it has stronger learning\ncapabilities and is more suitable for solving image recognition problems.\nHowever, there are still several challenges that must be faced to implement\ndeep learning, such as the need for large datasets, requiring large computing\nresources, and requiring careful parameter setting to prevent overfitting or\nunderfitting. In responding to the challenge of classifying Alzheimer's disease\nusing deep learning, this study propose the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nmethod with the Residual Network 18 Layer (ResNet-18) architecture. To overcome\nthe need for a large and balanced dataset, transfer learning from ImageNet is\nused and weighting the loss function values so that each class has the same\nweight.

It is a fatal brain disease\nthat mostly affects the elderly. It steers the decline of cognitive and\nbiological functions of the brain and shrinks the brain successively, which in\nturn is known as Atrophy. For an accurate diagnosis of Alzheimers disease,\ncutting edge methods like machine learning are essential. Recently, machine\nlearning has gained a lot of attention and popularity in the medical industry.\nAs the illness progresses, those with Alzheimers have a far more difficult time\ndoing even the most basic tasks, and in the worst case, their brain completely\nstops functioning. A persons likelihood of having early-stage Alzheimers\ndisease may be determined using the ML method. In this analysis, papers on\nAlzheimers disease diagnosis based on deep learning techniques and\nreinforcement learning between 2008 and 2023 found in google scholar were\nstudied. Sixty relevant papers obtained after the search was considered for\nthis study. These papers were analysed based on the biomarkers of AD and the\nmachine-learning techniques used. The analysis shows that deep learning methods\nhave an immense ability to extract features and classify AD with good accuracy.\nThe DRL methods have not been used much in the field of image processing.

Among older adults, it is the most\nfrequent cause of dementia. Although there is presently no treatment for\nAlzheimer's disease, scientific trials are ongoing to discover drugs to combat\nthe condition. Treatments to slow the signs of dementia are also available.\nMany researchers throughout the world became interested in developing\ncomputer-aided diagnosis systems to aid in the early identification of this\ndeadly disease and assure an accurate diagnosis. In particular, image based\napproaches have been coupled with machine learning techniques to address the\nchallenges of Alzheimer's disease detection. This study proposes a computer\naided diagnosis system to detect Alzheimer's disease from biomarkers captured\nusing neuroimaging techniques. The proposed approach relies on deep learning\ntechniques to extract the relevant visual features from the image collection to\naccurately predict the Alzheimer's class value.

We argue for a\nphenomenon that has never before been discussed in the context of polymer\nphysics: Like ice and water together, the intracellular domain of the amyloid\nprecursor protein forms a state of phase coexistence with another protein. This\nleads to an inherent instability that could well be among the missing pieces in\nthe puzzle of Alzheimer's disease.",

Participants have heterogeneous cognitive trajectories\nand many do not decline during trials, which reduces a study's power to detect\ntreatment effects.

We developed machine learning models to predict cognitive\ntrajectories in participants with early Alzheimer's disease (n=1342) and\npresymptomatic individuals (n=756) over 24 and 48 months respectively. Baseline\nmagnetic resonance imaging, cognitive tests, demographics, and APOE genotype\nwere used to classify decliners, measured by an increase in CDR-Sum of Boxes,\nand non-decliners with up to 79% area under the curve (cross-validated and\nout-of-sample). Using these prognostic models to recruit enriched cohorts of\ndecliners can reduce required sample sizes by as much as 51%, while maintaining\nthe same detection power, and thus may improve trial quality, derisk endpoint\nfailures, and accelerate therapeutic development in Alzheimer's disease.",

In this work, we introduce a novel semi-supervised hypergraph\nlearning framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Our framework allows for\nhigher-order relations among multi-modal imaging and non-imaging data whilst\nrequiring a tiny labelled set. Firstly, we introduce a dual embedding strategy\nfor constructing a robust hypergraph that preserves the data semantics. We\nachieve this by enforcing perturbation invariance at the image and graph levels\nusing a contrastive based mechanism. Secondly, we present a dynamically\nadjusted hypergraph diffusion model, via a semi-explicit flow, to improve the\npredictive uncertainty. We demonstrate, through our experiments, that our\nframework is able to outperform current techniques for Alzheimer's disease\ndiagnosis.",

        "summary": "Multimodal neuroimage can provide complementary information about the\ndementia, but small size of complete multimodal data limits the ability in\nrepresentation learning. Moreover, the data distribution inconsistency from\ndifferent modalities may lead to ineffective fusion, which fails to\nsufficiently explore the intra-modal and inter-modal interactions and\ncompromises the disease diagnosis performance. To solve these problems, we\nproposed a novel multimodal representation learning and adversarial hypergraph\nfusion (MRL-AHF) framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using complete\ntrimodal images. First, adversarial strategy and pre-trained model are\nincorporated into the MRL to extract latent representations from multimodal\ndata. Then two hypergraphs are constructed from the latent representations and\nthe adversarial network based on graph convolution is employed to narrow the\ndistribution difference of hyperedge features. Finally, the hyperedge-invariant\nfeatures are fused for disease prediction by hyperedge convolution. Experiments\non the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database\ndemonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on Alzheimer's disease\ndetection compared with other related models and provides a possible way to\nunderstand the underlying mechanisms of disorder's progression by analyzing the\nabnormal brain connections.",

Since brain morphology is known to play a\ncrucial role in Alzheimer's diagnosis, we propose the use of learnable\npseudo-morphological modules aimed at producing shape-aware, anatomically\nmeaningful class-specific augmentations in combination with a supervised\ncontrastive learning module to extract robust class-specific representations.\nExperiments conducted across three datasets show improved performance and\ngeneralization capacity, especially under class imbalance and imaging protocol\nvariations.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which causes\nproblems with memory, thinking and behavior. Growing evidence has shown that\nthe brain connectivity network experiences alterations for such a complex\ndisease. Network comparison, also known as differential network analysis, is\nthus particularly powerful to reveal the disease pathologies and identify\nclinical biomarkers for medical diagnoses (classification). Data from\nneurophysiological measurements are multi-dimensional and in matrix-form, which\nposes major challenges in brain connectivity analysis and medical diagnoses.\nNaive vectorization method is not sufficient as it ignores the structural\ninformation within the matrix. In the article, we adopt the Kronecker product\ncovariance matrix framework to capture both spatial and temporal correlations\nof the matrix-variate data while the temporal covariance matrix is treated as a\nnuisance parameter. By recognizing that the strengths of network connections\nmay vary across subjects, we develop an ensemble-learning procedure, which\nidentifies the differential interaction patterns of brain regions between the\nAD group and the control group and conducts medical diagnosis (classification)\nof AD simultaneously. We applied the proposed procedure to functional\nconnectivity analysis of fMRI dataset related with Alzheimer's disease. The hub\nnodes and differential interaction patterns identified are consistent with\nexisting experimental studies, and satisfactory out-of-sample classification\nperformance is achieved for medical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) ravages the cognitive ability of more than 5 million\nAmericans and creates an enormous strain on the health care system. This paper\nproposes a machine learning predictive model for AD development without medical\nimaging and with fewer clinical visits and tests, in hopes of earlier and\ncheaper diagnoses. That earlier diagnoses could be critical in the\neffectiveness of any drug or medical treatment to cure this disease. Our model\nis trained and validated using demographic, biomarker and cognitive test data\nfrom two prominent research studies: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) and Australian Imaging, Biomarker Lifestyle Flagship Study of\nAging (AIBL). We systematically explore different machine learning models,\npre-processing methods and feature selection techniques. The most performant\nmodel demonstrates greater than 90% accuracy and recall in predicting AD, and\nthe results generalize across sub-studies of ADNI and to the independent AIBL\nstudy. We also demonstrate that these results are robust to reducing the number\nof clinical visits or tests per visit. Using a metaclassification algorithm and\nlongitudinal data analysis we are able to produce a \"lean\" diagnostic protocol\nwith only 3 tests and 4 clinical visits that can predict Alzheimer's\ndevelopment with 87% accuracy and 79% recall. This novel work can be adapted\ninto a practical early diagnostic tool for predicting the development of\nAlzheimer's that maximizes accuracy while minimizing the number of necessary\ndiagnostic tests and clinical visits.",

The clinical manifestations of\nAlzheimer's disease are characterized by heterogeneity in age, disease span,\nprogression rate, impairment of memory and cognitive abilities.

Herein, we propose the utility of cerebral instantaneous phase and\nenvelope information in order to discriminate between Alzheimer's patients, MCI\nsubjects and healthy normal individuals from functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) data. To this end, after performing the region-of-interest (ROI)\nanalysis on fMRI data, different features covering power, entropy and coherency\naspects of data are derived from instantaneous phase and envelope sequences of\nROI signals. Various sets of features are calculated and fed to a sequential\nforward floating feature selection (SFFFS) to choose the most discriminative\nand informative sets of features. A Student's t-test has been used to select\nthe most relevant features from chosen sets. Finally, a K-NN classifier is used\nto distinguish between classes in a three-class categorization problem. The\nreported performance in overall accuracy using fMRI data of 111 combined\nsubjects, is 80.1% with 80.0% Sensitivity to both Alzheimer's and Normal\ncategories distinction and is comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches\nrecently proposed in this regard.

Therefore, many\nmethods have been introduced for this task based on deep learning. Among these\napproaches, the methods based on ROIs are in a good position in terms of\naccuracy and complexity. In these techniques, some specific parts of the brain\nare extracted as ROI manually for all of the patients. Extracting ROI manually\nis time-consuming and its results depend on human expertness and precision.\nMethod To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel smart method for\ndetecting ROIs automatically based on Explainable AI using Grad-Cam and a 3DCNN\nmodel that extracts ROIs per patient. After extracting the ROIs automatically,\nAlzheimer's disease is predicted using extracted ROI-based 3D CNN. Results We\nimplement our method on 176 MCI patients of the famous ADNI dataset and obtain\nremarkable results compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The accuracy\nacquired using 5-fold cross-validation is 98.6 and the AUC is 1. We also\ncompare the results of the ROI-based method with the whole brain-based method.\nThe results show that the performance is impressively increased.

While several approaches for functional connectivity obtain an\nun-directed network representing stochastic associations (correlations) between\nbrain regions, association does not necessarily imply causation. In contrast,\nCausal Functional Connectivity is more informative, providing a directed\nnetwork representing causal relationships between brain regions. In this paper,\nwe obtained the causal functional connectome for the whole brain from\nrecordings of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for\nsubjects from three clinical groups: cognitively normal, mild cognitive\nimpairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We applied the recently developed\nTime-aware PC (TPC) algorithm to infer the causal functional connectome for the\nwhole brain.

We then perform an exploratory analysis to identify the causal brain\nconnections between brain regions which have altered strengths between pairs of\nsubject groups, and over the three subject groups, based on edge-wise p-values\nfrom statistical tests.

        "title": "A Machine Learning Approach to Analyze the Effects of Alzheimer's\n  Disease on Handwriting through Lognormal Features",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most incisive illnesses among the\nneurodegenerative ones, and it causes a progressive decline in cognitive\nabilities that, in the worst cases, becomes severe enough to interfere with\ndaily life. Currently, there is no cure, so an early diagnosis is strongly\nneeded to try and slow its progression through medical treatments. Handwriting\nanalysis is considered a potential tool for detecting and understanding certain\nneurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. While handwriting\nanalysis alone cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's, it may\noffer some insights and be used for a comprehensive assessment. The\nSigma-lognormal model is conceived for movement analysis and can also be\napplied to handwriting. This model returns a set of lognormal parameters as\noutput, which forms the basis for the computation of novel and significant\nfeatures. This paper presents a machine learning approach applied to\nhandwriting features extracted through the sigma-lognormal model. The aim is to\ndevelop a support system to help doctors in the diagnosis and study of\nAlzheimer, evaluate the effectiveness of the extracted features and finally\nstudy the relation among them.",

        "summary": "We employ the Hopfield model as a simplified framework to explore both the\nmemory deficits and the biochemical processes characteristic of Alzheimer's\ndisease. By simulating neuronal death and synaptic degradation through\nincreasing the number of stored patterns and introducing noise into the\nsynaptic weights, we demonstrate hallmark symptoms of dementia, including\nmemory loss, confusion, and delayed retrieval times. As the network's capacity\nis exceeded, retrieval errors increase, mirroring the cognitive confusion\nobserved in Alzheimer's patients. Additionally, we simulate the impact of\nsynaptic degradation by varying the sparsity of the weight matrix, showing\nimpaired memory recall and reduced retrieval success as noise levels increase.\nFurthermore, we extend our model to connect memory loss with biochemical\nprocesses linked to Alzheimer's. By simulating the role of reduced insulin\nsensitivity over time, we show how it can trigger increased calcium influx into\nmitochondria, leading to misfolded proteins and the formation of amyloid\nplaques. These findings, modeled over time, suggest that both neuronal\ndegradation and metabolic factors contribute to the progressive decline seen in\nAlzheimer's disease. Our work offers a computational framework for\nunderstanding the dual impact of synaptic and metabolic dysfunction in\nneurodegenerative diseases.",

These non-invasive imaging techniques are cost-effective and more\naccessible than alternative neuroimaging tools. However, interpreting and\nclassifying multi-slice scans produced by OCT devices is time-consuming and\nchallenging even for trained practitioners.\n  There are surveys on machine learning and deep learning approaches concerning\nthe automated analysis of OCT scans for various diseases such as glaucoma.\nHowever, the current literature lacks an extensive survey on the diagnosis of\nAlzheimer's disease or cognitive impairment using OCT or OCTA. This has\nmotivated us to do a comprehensive survey aimed at machine/deep learning\nscientists or practitioners who require an introduction to the problem. The\npaper contains 1) an introduction to the medical background of Alzheimer's\nDisease and Cognitive Impairment and their diagnosis using OCT and OCTA imaging\nmodalities, 2) a review of various technical proposals for the problem and the\nsub-problems from an automated analysis perspective, 3) a systematic review of\nthe recent deep learning studies and available OCT/OCTA datasets directly aimed\nat the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Impairment.

We followed\nthe PRISMA approach to screen an initial pool of 3073 references and determined\nten relevant studies (N=10, out of 3073) that directly targeted AD diagnosis.\nWe identified the lack of open OCT/OCTA datasets (about Alzheimer's disease) as\nthe main issue that is impeding the progress in the field.",

        "summary": "The thalamus and its constituent nuclei are critical for a broad range of\ncognitive and sensorimotor processes, and implicated in many neurological and\nneurodegenerative conditions. However, the functional involvement and\nspecificity of thalamic nuclei in human neuroimaging is underappreciated and\nnot well studied due, in part, to technical challenges of accurately\nidentifying and segmenting nuclei. This challenge is further exacerbated by a\nlack of common nomenclature for comparing segmentation methods. Here, we use\ndata from healthy young (Human Connectome Project, 100 subjects) and older\nhealthy adults, plus those with minor cognitive impairment and Alzheimer$'$s\ndisease (Alzheimer$'$s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 540 subjects), to\nbenchmark four state of the art thalamic segmentation methods for T1 MRI\n(FreeSurfer, HIPS-THOMAS, SCS-CNN, and T1-THOMAS) under a single segmentation\nframework. Segmentations were compared using overlap and dissimilarity metrics\nto the Morel stereotaxic atlas. We also quantified each method$'$s estimation\nof thalamic nuclear degeneration across Alzheimer$'$s disease progression, and\nhow accurately early and late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimers disease\ncould be distinguished from healthy controls. We show that HIPS-THOMAS produced\nthe most effective segmentations of individual thalamic nuclei and was also\nmost accurate in discriminating healthy controls from those with mild cognitive\nimpairment and Alzheimer$'$s disease using individual nucleus volumes. This\nwork is the first to systematically compare the efficacy of anatomical thalamic\nsegmentation approaches under a unified nomenclature. We also provide\nrecommendations of which segmentation method to use for studying the functional\nrelevance of specific thalamic nuclei, based on their overlap and dissimilarity\nwith the Morel atlas.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease gradually affects several components including the\ncerebral dimension with brain atrophies, the cognitive dimension with a decline\nin various functions and the functional dimension with impairment in the daily\nliving activities. Understanding how such dimensions interconnect is crucial\nfor AD research. However it requires to simultaneously capture the dynamic and\nmultidimensional aspects, and to explore temporal relationships between\ndimensions. We propose an original dynamic structural model that accounts for\nall these features. The model defines dimensions as latent processes and\ncombines a multivariate linear mixed model and a system of difference equations\nto model trajectories and temporal relationships between latent processes in\nfinely discrete time. Dimensions are simultaneously related to their observed\n(possibly multivariate) markers through nonlinear equations of observation.\nParameters are estimated in the maximum likelihood framework enjoying a closed\nform for the likelihood. We demonstrate in a simulation study that this dynamic\nmodel in discrete time benefits the same causal interpretation of temporal\nrelationships as models defined in continuous time as long as the\ndiscretization step remains small. The model is then applied to the data of the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Three longitudinal dimensions\n(cerebral anatomy, cognitive ability and functional autonomy) measured by 6\nmarkers are analyzed and their temporal structure is contrasted between\ndifferent clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease.

We show that gamma-ray spectrometry of the mother\nnucleus 210Pb can be used. It is a direct measurement without tampering with\nthe sample. However, because this technique is far less sensitive than alpha-\nand beta-spectrometry, activity values previously published were out-of-reach\nfor gamma-ray spectrometry. This is no longer the case with our ultra-low\nbackground high purity Ge detectors which have been developed in the frame of\nthe neutrino experiments. To ascertain this possibility, ten brain samples from\nAlzheimer patients and blanks as well as 10 samples of brain tumors have been\ninvestigated and results were cross-checked with two different spectrometers.\nLocalization of the samples in the brain was not known to avoid biased\ninterpretation of the results. Data taking lasted between 1 and 4 weeks for\neach sample. All ten Alzheimer/blank samples were below the limit of detection\n(LOD), 3 out of the 10 tumors lead to positive results (3.8 to 4.9 mBq/g of\n210Pb) with a statistical significance of at least 3 standard deviations.\nPotential followup of this method is to enhance the detector sensitivity,\nhaving the spectrometer installed in an underground laboratory such as the one\nin Modane under the Alps where the background noise is 30- fold less than at\nthe present location in Bordeaux.

        "summary": "Ensemble learning use multiple algorithms to obtain better predictive\nperformance than any single one of its constituent algorithms could. With\ngrowing popularity of deep learning, researchers have started to ensemble them\nfor various purposes. Few if any, however, has used the deep learning approach\nas a means to ensemble algorithms. This paper presents a deep ensemble learning\nframework which aims to harness deep learning algorithms to integrate\nmultisource data and tap the wisdom of experts. At the voting layer, a sparse\nautoencoder is trained for feature learning to reduce the correlation of\nattributes and diversify the base classifiers ultimately. At the stacking\nlayer, a nonlinear feature-weighted method based on deep belief networks is\nproposed to rank the base classifiers which may violate the conditional\nindependence. Neural network is used as meta classifier. At the optimizing\nlayer, under-sampling and threshold-moving are used to cope with cost-sensitive\nproblem. Optimized predictions are obtained based on ensemble of probabilistic\npredictions by similarity calculation. The proposed deep ensemble learning\nframework is used for Alzheimers disease classification. Experiments with the\nclinical dataset from national Alzheimers coordinating center demonstrate that\nthe classification accuracy of our proposed framework is 4% better than 6\nwell-known ensemble approaches as well as the standard stacking algorithm.\nAdequate coverage of more accurate diagnostic services can be provided by\nutilizing the wisdom of averaged physicians.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most concerned neurodegenerative\ndiseases. In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis attached great\nsignificance to artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms. Among\nthe diverse modality imaging data, T1-weighted MRI and 18F-FDGPET are widely\nresearched for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional\nneural network (CNN) to fuse the multi-modality information including T1-MRI\nand FDG-PDT images around the hippocampal area for the diagnosis of AD.\nDifferent from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does\nnot require manually extracted features, and utilizes the stateof-art 3D\nimage-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD.\nTo validate the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier\nwith paired T1-MRI and FDG-PET images using the ADNI datasets, including 731\nNormal (NL) subjects, 647 AD subjects, 441 stable MCI (sMCI) subjects and 326\nprogressive MCI (pMCI) subjects. We obtained the maximal accuracies of 90.10%\nfor NL/AD task, 87.46% for NL/pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI/pMCI task. The\nproposed framework yields comparative results against state-of-the-art\napproaches. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that (1)\nsegmentation is not a prerequisite by using CNN, (2) the hippocampal area\nprovides enough information to give a reference to AD diagnosis.

        "summary": "Studying the relationship between neuroanatomy and cognitive decline due to\nAlzheimer's has been a major research focus in the last decade. However, to\ninfer cause-effect relationships rather than simple associations from\nobservational data, we need to (i) express the causal relationships leading to\ncognitive decline in a graphical model, and (ii) ensure the causal effect of\ninterest is identifiable from the collected data. We derive a causal graph from\nthe current clinical knowledge on cause and effect in the Alzheimer's disease\ncontinuum, and show that identifiability of the causal effect requires all\nconfounders to be known and measured. However, in complex neuroimaging studies,\nwe neither know all potential confounders nor do we have data on them. To\nalleviate this requirement, we leverage the dependencies among multiple causes\nby deriving a substitute confounder via a probabilistic latent factor model. In\nour theoretical analysis, we prove that using the substitute confounder enables\nidentifiability of the causal effect of neuroanatomy on cognition. We\nquantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on semi-synthetic\ndata, where we know the true causal effects, and illustrate its use on real\ndata on the Alzheimer's disease continuum, where it reveals important causes\nthat otherwise would have been missed.",

In this work, a prior guided adversarial representation\nlearning and hypergraph perceptual network (PGARL-HPN) is proposed to predict\nabnormal brain connections using triple-modality medical images. Concretely, a\nprior distribution from the anatomical knowledge is estimated to guide\nmultimodal representation learning using an adversarial strategy. Also, the\npairwise collaborative discriminator structure is further utilized to narrow\nthe difference of representation distribution. Moreover, the hypergraph\nperceptual network is developed to effectively fuse the learned representations\nwhile establishing high-order relations within and between multimodal images.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other\nrelated methods in analyzing and predicting Alzheimer's disease progression.\nMore importantly, the identified abnormal connections are partly consistent\nwith the previous neuroscience discoveries.

Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the\nfamous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified structural MRI data of\nAlzheimer's subjects from normal controls where the accuracy of test data on\ntrained data reached 98.84%.

Six different systems have been built and compared: four of them\nare speech-based and the other two systems are text-based. The x-vector,\ni-vector, and statistical speech-based functionals features are evaluated. As a\nlower speaking fluency is a common pattern in patients with Alzheimer's\ndisease, rhythmic features are also proposed. For transcription analysis, two\nsystems are proposed: one uses GloVe word embedding features and the other uses\nseveral features extracted by language modelling. Several intra-modality and\ninter-modality score fusion strategies are investigated. The performance of\nsingle modality and multimodal systems are presented.

This calls for scalable, cost-effective, and robust methods for\ndetection of Alzheimer's dementia (AD). We present a novel architecture that\nleverages acoustic, cognitive, and linguistic features to form a multimodal\nensemble system. It uses specialized artificial neural networks with temporal\ncharacteristics to detect AD and its severity, which is reflected through\nMini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores. We first evaluate it on the ADReSS\nchallenge dataset, which is a subject-independent and balanced dataset matched\nfor age and gender to mitigate biases, and is available through DementiaBank.\nOur system achieves state-of-the-art test accuracy, precision, recall, and\nF1-score of 83.3% each for AD classification, and state-of-the-art test root\nmean squared error (RMSE) of 4.60 for MMSE score regression. To the best of our\nknowledge, the system further achieves state-of-the-art AD classification\naccuracy of 88.0% when evaluated on the full benchmark DementiaBank Pitt\ndatabase.

We performed simulation\nexperiments to benchmark the accuracy of the proposed approaches and to select\nthe optimal approach. Subsequently, the chosen approach was applied to the\nbaseline data of 417 cognitively normal, 235 mild cognitively impaired who\nconvert to AD within 3 years, and 342 AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to gain new insights into the effect of\nAPOE carriership on the disease progression timeline of AD.

While promising results are reported across nearly all\n51 studies, very few have been implemented in clinical research or practice.

        "summary": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage, also known as\nmild cognitive impairment (MCI), is critical since some patients with\nprogressive MCI will develop the disease. We propose a multi-stream deep\nconvolutional neural network fed with patch-based imaging data to classify\nstable MCI and progressive MCI. First, we compare MRI images of Alzheimer's\ndisease with cognitively normal subjects to identify distinct anatomical\nlandmarks using a multivariate statistical test. These landmarks are then used\nto extract patches that are fed into the proposed multi-stream convolutional\nneural network to classify MRI images. Next, we train the architecture in a\nseparate scenario using samples from Alzheimer's disease images, which are\nanatomically similar to the progressive MCI ones and cognitively normal images\nto compensate for the lack of progressive MCI training data. Finally, we\ntransfer the trained model weights to the proposed architecture in order to\nfine-tune the model using progressive MCI and stable MCI data. Experimental\nresults on the ADNI-1 dataset indicate that our method outperforms existing\nmethods for MCI classification, with an F1-score of 85.96%.",

        "summary": "Dementia of Alzheimer's Type (DAT) is a complex disorder influenced by\nnumerous factors, but it is unclear how each factor contributes to disease\nprogression. An in-depth examination of these factors may yield an accurate\nestimate of time-to-conversion to DAT for patients at various disease stages.\nWe used 401 subjects with 63 features from MRI, genetic, and CDC (Cognitive\ntests, Demographic, and CSF) data modalities in the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We used a deep learning-based survival\nanalysis model that extends the classic Cox regression model to predict\ntime-to-conversion to DAT. Our findings showed that genetic features\ncontributed the least to survival analysis, while CDC features contributed the\nmost. Combining MRI and genetic features improved survival prediction over\nusing either modality alone, but adding CDC to any combination of features only\nworked as well as using only CDC features. Consequently, our study demonstrated\nthat using the current clinical procedure, which includes gathering cognitive\ntest results, can outperform survival analysis results produced using costly\ngenetic or CSF data.",

In this approach, the\nmissing data are first imputed using a doubly-robust augmented inverse\nprobability weighting (AIPW) estimator, then the imputed completed data are\nsubstituted into a full-data estimating equation, and the estimate is obtained\nusing standard software. The imputed completed data may be inspected and\ncompared to the observed data, and standard model diagnostics are available.\nThe same imputed completed data can be used for several different estimands,\nsuch as subgroup analyses in a clinical trial, allowing for reduced computation\nand increased consistency across analyses. We present two specific DR\nimputation estimators, AIPW-I and AIPW-S, study their theoretical properties,\nand investigate their performance by simulation. AIPW-S has substantially\nreduced computational burden compared to many other DR estimators, at the cost\nof some loss of efficiency and the requirement of stronger assumptions.\nSimulation studies support the theoretical properties and good performance of\nthe DR imputation framework. Importantly, we demonstrate their ability to\naddress time-varying covariates, such as a time by treatment interaction.

The prognosis of the disease solely\ndepends on treating symptoms as they arise and proper caregiving, as there are\nno current medical preventative treatments apart from newly developing drugs\nwhich can, at most, slow the progression. Thus, early detection of the disease\nat its most premature state is of paramount importance. This work aims to\nsurvey imaging biomarkers corresponding to the progression of AD and also\nreviews some of the existing feature extraction methods. A longitudinal study\nof structural MR images was performed for given temporal test subjects with AD\nselected randomly from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)\ndatabase. A pipeline was implemented to study the data, including modern\npre-processing techniques such as spatial image registration, skull stripping,\ninhomogeneity correction and tissue segmentation using an unsupervised learning\napproach using intensity histogram information. The temporal data across\nmultiple visits is used to study the structural change in volumes of these\ntissue classes, namely, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM), and white\nmatter (WM) as the patients progressed further into the disease. To detect\nchanges in volume trends, we also analyse the data with a modified Mann-Kendall\nstatistic. The segmented features thus extracted and the subsequent trend\nanalysis provide insights such as atrophy, increase or intolerable shifting of\nGM, WM and CSF and should help in future research for automated analysis of\nAlzheimer's detection with clinical domain explainability.",

EHR are essential for utilizing\nadvanced technologies such as deep learning (DL), enabling healthcare providers\nto analyze extensive data, extract valuable insights, and make precise and\ndata-driven clinical decisions. DL methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNN) have been utilized to analyze EHR to model disease progression and\npredict diagnosis. However, these methods do not address some inherent\nirregularities in EHR data such as irregular time intervals between clinical\nvisits. Furthermore, most DL models are not interpretable. In this study, we\npropose two interpretable DL architectures based on RNN, namely Time-Aware RNN\n(TA-RNN) and TA-RNN-Autoencoder (TA-RNN-AE) to predict patient's clinical\noutcome in EHR at next visit and multiple visits ahead, respectively. To\nmitigate the impact of irregular time intervals, we propose incorporating time\nembedding of the elapsed times between visits. For interpretability, we propose\nemploying a dual-level attention mechanism that operates between visits and\nfeatures within each visit.\n  Results: The results of the experiments conducted on Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center\n(NACC) datasets indicated superior performance of proposed models for\npredicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) compared to state-of-the-art and baseline\napproaches based on F2 and sensitivity.

        "summary": "Classifying 3D MRI images for early detection of Alzheimer's disease is a\ncritical task in medical imaging. Traditional approaches using Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers face significant challenges in this\ndomain. CNNs, while effective in capturing local spatial features, struggle\nwith long-range dependencies and often require extensive computational\nresources for high-resolution 3D data. Transformers, on the other hand, excel\nin capturing global context but suffer from quadratic complexity in inference\ntime and require substantial memory, making them less efficient for large-scale\n3D MRI data. To address these limitations, we propose the use of Vision Mamba,\nan advanced model based on State Space Models (SSMs), for the classification of\n3D MRI images to detect Alzheimer's disease. Vision Mamba leverages dynamic\nstate representations and the selective scan algorithm, allowing it to\nefficiently capture and retain important spatial information across 3D volumes.\nBy dynamically adjusting state transitions based on input features, Vision\nMamba can selectively retain relevant information, leading to more accurate and\ncomputationally efficient processing of 3D MRI data. Our approach combines the\nparallelizable nature of convolutional operations during training with the\nefficient, recurrent processing of states during inference. This architecture\nnot only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the model's\nability to handle long-range dependencies within 3D medical images.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Vision Mamba outperforms traditional CNN\nand Transformer models accuracy, making it a promising tool for the early\ndetection of Alzheimer's disease using 3D MRI data.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with\nincreasing prevalence among the aging population, necessitating early and\naccurate diagnosis for effective disease management. In this study, we present\na novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both 2D Convolutional\nNeural Networks (2D-CNN) and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN), along\nwith a custom loss function and volumetric data augmentation, to enhance\nfeature extraction and improve classification performance in AD diagnosis.\nAccording to extensive experiments, AlzhiNet outperforms standalone 2D and 3D\nmodels, highlighting the importance of combining these complementary\nrepresentations of data. The depth and quality of 3D volumes derived from the\naugmented 2D slices also significantly influence the model's performance. The\nresults indicate that carefully selecting weighting factors in hybrid\npredictions is imperative for achieving optimal results. Our framework has been\nvalidated on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) from Kaggle and MIRIAD\ndatasets, obtaining accuracies of 98.9% and 99.99%, respectively, with an AUC\nof 100%. Furthermore, AlzhiNet was studied under a variety of perturbation\nscenarios on the Alzheimer's Kaggle dataset, including Gaussian noise,\nbrightness, contrast, salt and pepper noise, color jitter, and occlusion. The\nresults obtained show that AlzhiNet is more robust to perturbations than\nResNet-18, making it an excellent choice for real-world applications. This\napproach represents a promising advancement in the early diagnosis and\ntreatment planning for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "title": "Flexi-Fuzz least squares SVM for Alzheimer's diagnosis: Tackling noise,\n  outliers, and class imbalance",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading neurodegenerative condition and the\nprimary cause of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline and\nmemory loss. Its progression, marked by shrinkage in the cerebral cortex, is\nirreversible. Numerous machine learning algorithms have been proposed for the\nearly diagnosis of AD. However, they often struggle with the issues of noise,\noutliers, and class imbalance. To tackle the aforementioned limitations, in\nthis article, we introduce a novel, robust, and flexible membership scheme\ncalled Flexi-Fuzz. This scheme integrates a novel flexible weighting mechanism,\nclass probability, and imbalance ratio. The proposed flexible weighting\nmechanism assigns the maximum weight to samples within a specific proximity to\nthe center, with a gradual decrease in weight beyond a certain threshold. This\napproach ensures that samples near the class boundary still receive significant\nweight, maintaining their influence in the classification process. Class\nprobability is used to mitigate the impact of noisy samples, while the\nimbalance ratio addresses class imbalance. Leveraging this, we incorporate the\nproposed Flexi-Fuzz membership scheme into the least squares support vector\nmachines (LSSVM) framework, resulting in a robust and flexible model termed\nFlexi-Fuzz-LSSVM. We determine the class-center using two methods: the\nconventional mean approach and an innovative median approach, leading to two\nmodel variants, Flexi-Fuzz-LSSVM-I and Flexi-Fuzz-LSSVM-II. To validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed Flexi-Fuzz-LSSVM models, we evaluated them on\nbenchmark UCI and KEEL datasets, both with and without label noise.\nAdditionally, we tested the models on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) dataset for AD diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe superiority of the Flexi-Fuzz-LSSVM models over baseline models.",

This research work primary uses transfer\nlearning models such as ResNet, ImageNet, and VNet to extract high-level\nfeatures from medical image data.

This way, the\ndecentralized model benefits from the large and diversified dataset that it is\ntrained upon while ensuring confidentiality. The cipher-based encryption\nmechanism is added that allows us to secure the transportation of data and\nfurther ensure the privacy and integrity of patient information throughout\ntraining and classification.

        "summary": "Predicting the risk of clinical progression from cognitively normal (CN)\nstatus to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) is\ncritical for early intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Traditional\nsurvival models often fail to capture complex longitudinal biomarker patterns\nassociated with disease progression. We propose an ensemble survival analysis\nframework integrating multiple survival models to improve early prediction of\nclinical progression in initially cognitively normal individuals. We analyzed\nlongitudinal biomarker data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) cohort, including 721 participants, limiting analysis to up\nto three visits (baseline, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up). Of these,\n142 (19.7%) experienced clinical progression to MCI or AD. Our approach\ncombined penalized Cox regression (LASSO, Elastic Net) with advanced survival\nmodels (Random Survival Forest, DeepSurv, XGBoost). Model predictions were\naggregated using ensemble averaging and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA).\nPredictive performance was assessed using Harrell's concordance index (C-index)\nand time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). The ensemble model achieved a\npeak C-index of 0.907 and an integrated time-dependent AUC of 0.904,\noutperforming baseline-only models (C-index 0.608). One follow-up visit after\nbaseline significantly improved prediction accuracy (48.1% C-index, 48.2% AUC\ngains), while adding a second follow-up provided only marginal gains (2.1%\nC-index, 2.7% AUC). Our ensemble survival framework effectively integrates\ndiverse survival models and aggregation techniques to enhance early prediction\nof preclinical AD progression. These findings highlight the importance of\nleveraging longitudinal biomarker data, particularly one follow-up visit, for\naccurate risk stratification and personalized intervention strategies.",

Recently, research in brain connectivity has focused on dynamic\n(time-varying) brain networks that capture both spatial and temporal\ninformation on cortical, regional co-activity patterns. However, this approach\nhas been largely unexplored within the Alzheimer's spectrum. We analysed age-\nand sex-matched static and dynamic fMRI brain networks from 315 individuals\nwith Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and\ncognitively-normal Healthy Elderly (HE), using data from the ADNI-3 protocol.\nWe examined both similarities and differences between these groups, employing\nthe Juelich brain atlas for network nodes, sliding-window correlations for\ntime-varying network links, and non-parametric statistics to assess\nbetween-group differences at the link or the node centrality level. While the\nHE and MCI groups show similar static and dynamic networks at the link level,\nsignificant differences emerge compared to AD participants. We found stable\n(stationary) differences in patterns of functional connections between the\nwhite matter regions and the parietal lobe's, and somatosensory cortices, while\nmetastable (temporal) networks' differences were consistently found between the\namygdala and hippocampal formation. In addition, our node centrality analysis\nshowed that the white matter connectivity patterns are local in nature.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive\nprocedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning\ncan enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting\nanalysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from\nhealthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare\nthree recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional\nmachine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the\nrecurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw\ntemporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow\nthat recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they\nexhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods\nsignificantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with\nbalanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for\ncontinuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted\nfrom ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning\nmodels cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural\nassumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting\ndata. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical\nissues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable\ndirections for future research.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative\ndisorders worldwide. As it progresses, it leads to the deterioration of\ncognitive functions. Since AD is irreversible, early diagnosis is crucial for\nmanaging its progression. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents an\nintermediate stage between Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals and those with\nAD, and is considered a transitional phase from normal cognition to Alzheimer's\ndisease. Diagnosing MCI is particularly challenging due to the subtle\ndifferences between adjacent diagnostic categories. In this study, we propose\nEffNetViTLoRA, a generalized end-to-end model for AD diagnosis using the whole\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) dataset. Our model integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a\nVision Transformer (ViT) to capture both local and global features from MRI\nimages. Unlike previous studies that rely on limited subsets of data, our\napproach is trained on the full T1-weighted MRI dataset from ADNI, resulting in\na more robust and unbiased model. This comprehensive methodology enhances the\nmodel's clinical reliability. Furthermore, fine-tuning large pretrained models\noften yields suboptimal results when source and target dataset domains differ.\nTo address this, we incorporate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to effectively adapt\nthe pretrained ViT model to our target domain. This method enables efficient\nknowledge transfer and reduces the risk of overfitting. Our model achieves a\nclassification accuracy of 92.52% and an F1-score of 92.76% across three\ndiagnostic categories: AD, MCI, and CN for full ADNI dataset.",

Increasing evidence suggests that one of the causes of\nneurodegeneration is the overproduction of amyloid beta (A\\b{eta}) and the\ninability of A\\b{eta} peptides to be cleared from the brain, resulting in\nself-aggregation to form toxic oligomers, fibrils and plaques. One of the\npotential treatment options is to target A\\b{eta} and prevent self-aggregation\nto allow for a natural clearing of the brain. In this paper, we review the\ndrugs and drug delivery systems that target A\\b{eta} in relation to Alzheimer's\ndisease. Many attempts have been made to use anti-A\\b{eta} targeting molecules\ncapable of targeting A\\b{eta} (with much success in vitro and in vivo animal\nmodels), but the major obstacle to this technique is the challenge posed by the\nblood brain barrier (BBB). This highly selective barrier protects the brain\nfrom toxic molecules and pathogens and prevents the delivery of most drugs.\nTherefore novel A\\b{eta} aggregation inhibitor drugs will require well\nthought-out drug delivery systems to deliver sufficient concentrations to the\nbrain.",

We use\ndata comprising 18-month trajectories of 44 clinical variables from 1908\npatients with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's Disease to train a model\nfor personalized forecasting of disease progression. We simulate synthetic\npatient data including the evolution of each sub-component of cognitive exams,\nlaboratory tests, and their associations with baseline clinical\ncharacteristics, generating both predictions and their confidence intervals.\nOur unsupervised model predicts changes in total ADAS-Cog scores with the same\naccuracy as specifically trained supervised models and identifies\nsub-components associated with word recall as predictive of progression.

        "summary": "Recent studies suggest that combined analysis of Magnetic resonance\nimaging~(MRI) that measures brain atrophy and positron emission\ntomography~(PET) that quantifies hypo-metabolism provides improved accuracy in\ndiagnosing Alzheimer's disease. However, such techniques are limited by the\navailability of corresponding scans of each modality. Current work focuses on a\ncross-modal approach to estimate FDG-PET scans for the given MR scans using a\n3D U-Net architecture. The use of the complete MR image instead of a local\npatch based approach helps in capturing non-local and non-linear correlations\nbetween MRI and PET modalities. The quality of the estimated PET scans is\nmeasured using quantitative metrics such as MAE, PSNR and SSIM. The efficacy of\nthe proposed method is evaluated in the context of Alzheimer's disease\nclassification. The accuracy using only MRI is 70.18% while joint\nclassification using synthesized PET and MRI is 74.43% with a p-value of\n$0.06$. The significant improvement in diagnosis demonstrates the utility of\nthe synthesized PET scans for multi-modal analysis.",

Brain regional atrophy at specific levels was found to be\nmarginally associated with Alzheimer's disease outcomes. In this study, we\npropose an L1-type regularization for predictors that follow a hierarchical\ntree structure. Considering a tree as a directed acyclic graph, we interpret\nthe model parameters from a path analysis perspective. Under this concept, the\nproposed penalty regulates the total effect of each predictor on the outcome.\nWith regularity conditions, it is shown that under the proposed regularization,\nthe estimator of the model coefficient is consistent in L2-norm and the model\nselection is also consistent. By applying to a brain structural magnetic\nresonance imaging dataset acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative, the proposed approach identifies brain regions where atrophy in\nthese regions demonstrates the declination in memory. With regularization on\nthe total effects, the findings suggest that the impact of atrophy on memory\ndeficits is localized from small brain regions but at various levels of brain\nsegmentation.",

        "summary": "The diagnosis of early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for\ntimely treatment to slow further deterioration. Visualizing the morphological\nfeatures for the early stages of AD is of great clinical value. In this work, a\nnovel Multidirectional Perception Generative Adversarial Network (MP-GAN) is\nproposed to visualize the morphological features indicating the severity of AD\nfor patients of different stages. Specifically, by introducing a novel\nmultidirectional mapping mechanism into the model, the proposed MP-GAN can\ncapture the salient global features efficiently. Thus, by utilizing the\nclass-discriminative map from the generator, the proposed model can clearly\ndelineate the subtle lesions via MR image transformations between the source\ndomain and the pre-defined target domain. Besides, by integrating the\nadversarial loss, classification loss, cycle consistency loss and \\emph{L}1\npenalty, a single generator in MP-GAN can learn the class-discriminative maps\nfor multiple-classes. Extensive experimental results on Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that MP-GAN achieves\nsuperior performance compared with the existing methods. The lesions visualized\nby MP-GAN are also consistent with what clinicians observe.",

        "summary": "Increasing effort in brain image analysis has been dedicated to early\ndiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on neuroimaging data. Most existing\nstudies have been focusing on binary classification problems, e.g.,\ndistinguishing AD patients from normal control (NC) elderly or mild cognitive\nimpairment (MCI) individuals from NC elderly. However, identifying individuals\nwith AD and MCI, especially MCI individuals who will convert to AD (progressive\nMCI, pMCI), in a single setting, is needed to achieve the goal of early\ndiagnosis of AD. In this paper, we propose a deep ordinal ranking model for\ndistinguishing NC, stable MCI (sMCI), pMCI, and AD at an individual subject\nlevel, taking into account the inherent ordinal severity of brain degeneration\ncaused by normal aging, MCI, and AD, rather than formulating the classification\nas a multi-category classification problem. The proposed deep ordinal ranking\nmodel focuses on the hippocampal morphology of individuals and learns\ninformative and discriminative features automatically. Experiment results based\non a large cohort of individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) indicate that the proposed method can achieve better\nperformance than traditional multi-category classification techniques using\nshape and radiomics features from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ndata.",

        "summary": "Deep learning is attracting significant interest in the neuroimaging\ncommunity as a means to diagnose psychiatric and neurological disorders from\nstructural magnetic resonance images. However, there is a tendency amongst\nresearchers to adopt architectures optimized for traditional computer vision\ntasks, rather than design networks customized for neuroimaging data. We address\nthis by introducing NEURO-DRAM, a 3D recurrent visual attention model tailored\nfor neuroimaging classification. The model comprises an agent which, trained by\nreinforcement learning, learns to navigate through volumetric images,\nselectively attending to the most informative regions for a given task. When\napplied to Alzheimer's disease prediction, NEURODRAM achieves state-of-the-art\nclassification accuracy on an out-of-sample dataset, significantly\noutperforming a baseline convolutional neural network. When further applied to\nthe task of predicting which patients with mild cognitive impairment will be\ndiagnosed with Alzheimer's disease within two years, the model achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy with no additional training. Encouragingly, the agent\nlearns, without explicit instruction, a search policy in agreement with\nstandardized radiological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a route\nto automated biomarker discovery for more poorly understood disorders.",

It is\nof great scientific interest to investigate the association between the\noutcomes and time to AD onset. We model the multiple longitudinal outcomes as\nmultivariate sparse functional data and propose a functional joint model\nlinking multivariate functional data to event time data. In particular, we\npropose a multivariate functional mixed model (MFMM) to identify the shared\nprogression pattern and outcome-specific progression patterns of the outcomes,\nwhich enables more interpretable modeling of associations between outcomes and\nAD onset.

        "summary": "Recent evidence has shown that structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is\nan effective tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction and diagnosis. While\ntraditional MRI-based diagnosis uses images acquired at a single time point, a\nlongitudinal study is more sensitive and accurate in detecting early\npathological changes of the AD. Two main difficulties arise in longitudinal\nMRI-based diagnosis: (1) the inconsistent longitudinal scans among subjects\n(i.e., different scanning time and different total number of scans); (2) the\nheterogeneous progressions of high-dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) in\nMRI. In this work, we propose a novel feature selection and estimation method\nwhich can be applied to extract features from the heterogeneous longitudinal\nMRI. A key ingredient of our method is the combination of smoothing splines and\nthe $l_1$-penalty. We perform experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The results corroborate the advantages\nof the proposed method for AD prediction in longitudinal studies.",

To account for right censored time-to-event data, i.e., when it\nis only known that a patient did not develop Alzheimer's disease up to a\nparticular time point, we employ a loss commonly used in survival analysis. Our\nnetwork is trained end-to-end to combine information from a patient's\nhippocampus shape and clinical biomarkers.

The attention layers allow the network to focus on brain regions relevant\nto the task, while masking out irrelevant or noisy regions. In evaluations\nbased on 4,561 3-Tesla T1-weighted MRI scans from 4 phases of the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), salience maps for age and AD prediction\npartially overlapped, but lower-level features overlapped more than\nhigher-level features.

Moreover, non-intrusive techniques based\non spoken data are crucial for the development of AD automatic detection\nsystems. In this light, this paper is presented as a contribution to the ADReSS\nChallenge, aiming at improving AD automatic detection from spontaneous speech.\nTo this end, recordings from 108 participants, which are age-, gender-, and AD\ncondition-balanced, have been used as training set to perform two different\ntasks: classification into AD/non-AD conditions, and regression over the\nMini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Both tasks have been performed\nextracting 28 features from speech -- based on prosody and voice quality -- and\n51 features from the transcriptions -- based on lexical and turn-taking\ninformation. Our results achieved up to 87.5 % of classification accuracy using\na Random Forest classifier, and 4.54 of RMSE using a linear regression with\nstochastic gradient descent over the provided test set. This shows promising\nresults in the automatic detection of Alzheimer's Disease through speech and\nlexical features.",

        "summary": "Reliability in Neural Networks (NNs) is crucial in safety-critical\napplications like healthcare, and uncertainty estimation is a widely researched\nmethod to highlight the confidence of NNs in deployment. In this work, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware boosting technique for multi-modal ensembling to\npredict Alzheimer's Dementia Severity. The propagation of uncertainty across\nacoustic, cognitive, and linguistic features produces an ensemble system robust\nto heteroscedasticity in the data. Weighing the different modalities based on\nthe uncertainty estimates, we experiment on the benchmark ADReSS dataset, a\nsubject-independent and balanced dataset, to show that our method outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods while also reducing the overall entropy of the\nsystem.

        "summary": "The current state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) for Alzheimer's\nDisease diagnosis use different biomarker combinations to classify patients,\nbut do not allow extracting knowledge about the interactions of biomarkers.\nHowever, to improve our understanding of the disease, it is paramount to\nextract such knowledge from the learned model. In this paper, we propose a Deep\nFactorization Machine model that combines the ability of DNNs to learn complex\nrelationships and the ease of interpretability of a linear model. The proposed\nmodel has three parts: (i) an embedding layer to deal with sparse categorical\ndata, (ii) a Factorization Machine to efficiently learn pairwise interactions,\nand (iii) a DNN to implicitly model higher order interactions. In our\nexperiments on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed model classifies cognitive normal, mild cognitive\nimpaired, and demented patients more accurately than competing models. In\naddition, we show that valuable knowledge about the interactions among\nbiomarkers can be obtained.",

Based on the attention mechanism, our\nmodel effectively learns the fused features of brain structure and function and\nfinally is trained for the classification of Alzheimer's disease.

        "summary": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer Diagnostics (AD) is a challenging task due to\nits subtle and complex clinical symptoms. Deep learning-assisted medical\ndiagnosis using image recognition techniques has become an important research\ntopic in this field. The features have to accurately capture main variations of\nanatomical brain structures. However, time-consuming is expensive for feature\nextraction by deep learning training. This study proposes a novel Alzheimer's\ndisease detection model based on Convolutional Neural Networks. The model\nutilizes a pre-trained ResNet network as the backbone, incorporating\npost-fusion algorithm for 3D medical images and attention mechanisms. The\nexperimental results indicate that the employed 2D fusion algorithm effectively\nimproves the model's training expense. And the introduced attention mechanism\naccurately weights important regions in images, further enhancing the model's\ndiagnostic accuracy.",

In DISCN, a salient attention module fuses normal eye\nmovements with RGB and depth maps of visual stimuli using hierarchical salient\nattention (SAA) to evaluate comprehensive saliency maps, which contain\ninformation from both visual stimuli and normal eye movement behaviors.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is of increasing concern as populations achieve\nlonger lifespans. Many of the recent failed AD clinical trials recruiting\ncognitively intact individuals had a low number of AD events and were thus\nunderpowered. Previous trials have attempted to address this issue by requiring\nsigns of cognitive decline in brain imaging for trial enrollment. However, this\nmethod systematically excludes people of color and those without access to\nhealthcare and results in a selected sample that is not representative of the\ntarget population. We therefore propose the use of a predictive model based on\ncognitive test scores to enroll cognitively normal yet high risk participants\nin a hypothetical clinical trial. Cognitive test scores are a widely accessible\ntool, so their use in enrollment would be less likely to exclude marginalized\npopulations than biomarkers (such as imaging), which are overwhelmingly\navailable to exclusively high-income patients. We developed a novel\nlongitudinal factor model to predict AD conversion within a 3-year window based\non data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Through simulation,\nwe demonstrate that our predictive model provides substantial improvements in\nstatistical power and required sample size in hypothetical clinical trials\nacross a range of drug effects compared to other methods of subject selection.",

Unlike prior approaches that fuse modalities at a coarse\nlevel, CogniAlign leverages a word-level temporal alignment strategy that\nsynchronizes audio embeddings with corresponding textual tokens based on\ntranscription timestamps. This alignment supports the development of\ntoken-level fusion techniques, enabling more precise cross-modal interactions.\nTo fully exploit this alignment, we propose a Gated Cross-Attention Fusion\nmechanism, where audio features attend over textual representations, guided by\nthe superior unimodal performance of the text modality.

It can help in understanding the dynamics of disease progression and\nfacilitate early diagnosis and prognosis. In this work we propose a novel\ndiscriminative approach to EBM, which is shown to be more accurate than\nexisting state-of-the-art EBM methods. The method first estimates for each\nsubject an approximate ordering of events. Subsequently, the central ordering\nover all subjects is estimated by fitting a generalized Mallows model to these\napproximate subject-specific orderings. We also introduce the concept of\nrelative distance between events which helps in creating a disease progression\ntimeline. Subsequently, we propose a method to stage subjects by placing them\non the estimated disease progression timeline. We evaluated the proposed method\non Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data and compared the\nresults with existing state-of-the-art EBM methods. We also performed extensive\nexperiments on synthetic data simulating the progression of Alzheimer's\ndisease. The event orderings obtained on ADNI data seem plausible and are in\nagreement with the current understanding of progression of AD. The proposed\npatient staging algorithm performed consistently better than that of\nstate-of-the-art EBM methods. Event orderings obtained in simulation\nexperiments were more accurate than those of other EBM methods and the\nestimated disease progression timeline was observed to correlate with the\ntimeline of actual disease progression. The results of these experiments are\nencouraging and suggest that discriminative EBM is a promising approach to\ndisease progression modeling.",

Results: Our results on Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database showed that dementia scores using\ngenetic data could better predict future DAT progression for currently normal\ncontrol subjects (Accuracy=0.857) compared to MRI (Accuracy=0.143), while MRI\ncan better characterize subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment\n(Accuracy=0.614) compared to genetics (Accuracy=0.356). Combining MRI and\ngenetic data showed improved classification performance in the remaining\nstratified groups. Conclusion: MRI and genetic data can contribute to DAT\nprediction in different ways. MRI data reflects anatomical changes in the\nbrain, while genetic data can detect the risk of DAT progression prior to the\nsymptomatic onset. Combining information from multimodal data in the right way\ncan improve prediction performance.",

        "summary": "A crucial task for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to specify a\nstatistical method that can yield an efficient estimator and powerful test for\nthe treatment effect. A novel and effective strategy to obtain efficient and\npowerful treatment effect inferences is to incorporate predictions from\ngenerative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms into covariate adjustment\nfor the regression analysis of a RCT. Training a generative AI algorithm on\nhistorical control data enables one to construct a digital twin generator (DTG)\nfor RCT participants, which utilizes a participant's baseline covariates to\ngenerate a probability distribution for their potential control outcome.\nSummaries of the probability distribution from the DTG are highly predictive of\nthe trial outcome, and adjusting for these features via regression can thus\nimprove the quality of treatment effect inferences, while satisfying regulatory\nguidelines on statistical analyses, for a RCT. However, a critical assumption\nin this strategy is homoskedasticity, or constant variance of the outcome\nconditional on the covariates. In the case of heteroskedasticity, existing\ncovariate adjustment methods yield inefficient estimators and underpowered\ntests. We propose to address heteroskedasticity via a weighted prognostic\ncovariate adjustment methodology (Weighted PROCOVA) that adjusts for both the\nmean and variance of the regression model using information obtained from the\nDTG. We prove that our method yields unbiased treatment effect estimators, and\ndemonstrate via comprehensive simulation studies and case studies from\nAlzheimer's disease that it can reduce the variance of the treatment effect\nestimator, maintain the Type I error rate, and increase the power of the test\nfor the treatment effect from 80% to 85%~90% when the variances from the DTG\ncan explain 5%~10% of the variation in the RCT participants' outcomes.",

Various predictive models have been designed to\nrealize its early onset and study the long-term trajectories of cognitive test\nscores across populations of interest.

Multiple trajectories representing cognitive assessment\nfor the long-term have been developed based on various parameters, highlighting\nthe importance of classifying several groups based on disease progression\npatterns. In this study, a novel method capable of self-organized prediction,\nclassification, and the overlay of long-term cognitive trajectories based on\nshort-term individual data was developed, based on statistical and differential\nequation modeling. We validated the predictive accuracy of the proposed method\nfor the long-term trajectory of cognitive test score results on two cohorts:\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and the Japanese\nADNI study. We also presented two practical illustrations of the simultaneous\nevaluation of risk factor associated with both the onset and the longitudinal\nprogression of AD, and an innovative randomized controlled trial design for AD\nthat standardizes the heterogeneity of patients enrolled in a clinical trial.\nThese resources would improve the power of statistical hypothesis testing and\nhelp evaluate the therapeutic effect.

        "summary": "Clinical trials are critical in advancing medical treatments but often suffer\nfrom immense time and financial burden. Advances in statistical methodologies\nand artificial intelligence (AI) present opportunities to address these\ninefficiencies. Here we introduce Prognostic Covariate-Adjusted Mixed Models\nfor Repeated Measures (PROCOVA-MMRM) as an advantageous combination of\nprognostic covariate adjustment (PROCOVA) and Mixed Models for Repeated\nMeasures (MMRM). PROCOVA-MMRM utilizes time-matched prognostic scores generated\nfrom AI models to enhance the precision of treatment effect estimators for\nlongitudinal continuous outcomes, enabling reductions in sample size and\nenrollment times. We first provide a description of the background and\nimplementation of PROCOVA-MMRM, followed by two case study reanalyses where we\ncompare the performance of PROCOVA-MMRM versus the unadjusted MMRM. These\nreanalyses demonstrate significant improvements in statistical power and\nprecision in clinical indications with unmet medical need, specifically\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We also\nexplore the potential for sample size reduction with the prospective\nimplementation of PROCOVA-MMRM, finding that the same or better results could\nhave been achieved with fewer participants in these historical trials if the\nenhanced precision provided by PROCOVA-MMRM had been prospectively leveraged.\nWe also confirm the robustness of the statistical properties of PROCOVA-MMRM in\na variety of realistic simulation scenarios.

The functional data analysis perspective has been\nshown to provide an effective and flexible approach to address this problem for\nthe case where measurements are sparse but their times are randomly distributed\nover an interval.

For each subject the stretch of available data is\nmuch shorter than the time frame of interest, a common occurrence in\naccelerated longitudinal studies. An added challenge is introduced if a time\nproxy that is basic for usual longitudinal modeling is not available. This\nsituation arises in the case of Alzheimer's disease and comparable scenarios,\nwhere one is interested in time dynamics of declining performance, but the time\nof disease onset is unknown and the chronological age does not provide a\nmeaningful time reference for longitudinal modeling. Our main methodological\ncontribution is to address this problem with a novel approach. Key quantities\nfor our approach are conditional quantile trajectories for monotonic processes\nthat emerge as solutions of a dynamic system, and for which we obtain uniformly\nconsistent estimates.

In this work we propose a novel\ndiscriminative approach to EBM, which is shown to be more accurate as well as\ncomputationally more efficient than existing state-of-the art EBM methods.

To evaluate the accuracy, we\nperformed extensive experiments on synthetic data simulating the progression of\nAlzheimer's disease. Subsequently, the method was applied to the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to estimate the central event\nordering in the dataset.

        "summary": "Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging based 3D\ntopographic brain glucose metabolism patterns from normal controls (NC) and\nindividuals with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) are used to train a novel\nmulti-scale ensemble classification model. This ensemble model outputs a\nFDG-PET DAT score (FPDS) between 0 and 1 denoting the probability of a subject\nto be clinically diagnosed with DAT based on their metabolism profile. A novel\n7 group image stratification scheme is devised that groups images not only\nbased on their associated clinical diagnosis but also on past and future\ntrajectories of the clinical diagnoses, yielding a more continuous\nrepresentation of the different stages of DAT spectrum that mimics a real-world\nclinical setting. The potential for using FPDS as a DAT biomarker was validated\non a large number of FDG-PET images (N=2984) obtained from the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database taken across the proposed\nstratification, and a good classification AUC (area under the curve) of 0.78\nwas achieved in distinguishing between images belonging to subjects on a DAT\ntrajectory and those images taken from subjects not progressing to a DAT\ndiagnosis. Further, the FPDS biomarker achieved state-of-the-art performance on\nthe mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to DAT conversion prediction task with an\nAUC of 0.81, 0.80, 0.77 for the 2, 3, 5 years to conversion windows\nrespectively.",

Despite considerable efforts to find a cure for AD, there is a\n99.6% failure rate of clinical trials for AD drugs, likely because AD patients\ncannot easily be identified at early stages. This project investigated machine\nlearning approaches to predict the clinical state of patients in future years\nto benefit AD research. Clinical data from 1737 patients was obtained from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and was processed\nusing the \"All-Pairs\" technique, a novel methodology created for this project\ninvolving the comparison of all possible pairs of temporal data points for each\npatient. This data was then used to train various machine learning models.\nModels were evaluated using 7-fold cross-validation on the training dataset and\nconfirmed using data from a separate testing dataset (110 patients). A neural\nnetwork model was effective (mAUC = 0.866) at predicting the progression of AD\non a month-by-month basis, both in patients who were initially cognitively\nnormal and in patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment. Such a model\ncould be used to identify patients at early stages of AD and who are therefore\ngood candidates for clinical trials for AD therapeutics.",

        "summary": "The tight coupling between neuronal activity and the local increase of blood\nflow termed neurovascular coupling is essential for normal brain function. This\nmechanism of regulation is compromised in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In order to\ndetermine whether a purely vascular dysfunction or a neuronal alteration of\nblood vessels diameter control could be responsible for the impaired\nneurovascular coupling observed in AD, blood vessels reactivity in response to\ndifferent pharmacological stimulations was examined in double transgenic\nAPPxPS1 mice model of AD. Blood vessels movements were monitored using infrared\nvideomicroscopy ex vivo, in cortical slices of 8 month-old APPxPS1 and wild\ntype (WT) mice. We quantified vasomotor responses induced either by direct\nblood vessel stimulation with a thromboxane A 2 analogue, the U46619\n(9,11-dideoxy-11a,9a-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F2) or via the stimulation of\ninterneurons with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) agonist DMPP\n(1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide). Using both types of stimulation, no\nsignificant differences were detected for the amplitude of blood vessel\ndiameter changes between the transgenic APPxPS1 mice model of AD and WT mice,\nalthough the kinetics of recovery were slower in APPxPS1 mice. We find that\nactivation of neocortical interneurons with DMPP induced both vasodilation via\nNitric Oxide (NO) release and constriction via Neuropeptide Y (NPY) release.\nHowever, we observed a smaller proportion of reactive blood vessels following a\nneuronal activation in transgenic mice compared with WT mice. Altogether, these\nresults suggest that in this mouse model of AD, deficiency in the cortical\nneurovascular coupling essentially results from a neuronal rather than a\nvascular dysfunction.",

There were an estimated 5.8 million Americans living with\nAlzheimer's dementia in 2019, and this number will almost double every 20\nyears.

As\na medium to relieve this burden, online communities in social media websites\nsuch as Twitter, Reddit, and Yahoo!

However, there are often a limited number of\nrelevant questions and responses to search from, and posted questions are\nrarely answered immediately. Due to recent advancement in Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose\nto utilize AI to automatically generate answers to AD-related consumer\nquestions posted by caregivers and evaluate how good AI is at answering those\nquestions.

The aim of\nthis study is to infer structural changes in brain connectivity resulting from\ndisease progression using cortical thickness measurements from a cohort of\nparticipants who were either healthy control, or with mild cognitive\nimpairment, or Alzheimer's disease patients. For this purpose, we develop a\nnovel approach for inference of multiple networks with related edge values\nacross groups. Specifically, we infer a Gaussian graphical model for each group\nwithin a joint framework, where we rely on Bayesian hierarchical priors to link\nthe precision matrix entries across groups. Our proposal differs from existing\napproaches in that it flexibly learns which groups have the most similar edge\nvalues, and accounts for the strength of connection (rather than only edge\npresence or absence) when sharing information across groups. Our results\nidentify key alterations in structural connectivity which may reflect\ndisruptions to the healthy brain, such as decreased connectivity within the\noccipital lobe with increasing disease severity. We also illustrate the\nproposed method through simulations, where we demonstrate its performance in\nstructure learning and precision matrix estimation with respect to alternative\napproaches.",

The\ntraining data is built based on MMSE-rate values.

        "summary": "In this work, we consider the problem of predicting the course of a\nprogressive disease, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Progressive diseases often\nstart with mild symptoms that might precede a diagnosis, and each patient\nfollows their own trajectory. Patient trajectories exhibit wild variability,\nwhich can be associated with many factors such as genotype, age, or sex. An\nadditional layer of complexity is that, in real life, the amount and type of\ndata available for each patient can differ significantly. For example, for one\npatient we might have no prior history, whereas for another patient we might\nhave detailed clinical assessments obtained at multiple prior time-points. This\npaper presents a probabilistic model that can handle multiple modalities\n(including images and clinical assessments) and variable patient histories with\nirregular timings and missing entries, to predict clinical scores at future\ntime-points. We use a sigmoidal function to model latent disease progression,\nwhich gives rise to clinical observations in our generative model. We\nimplemented an approximate Bayesian inference strategy on the proposed model to\nestimate the parameters on data from a large population of subjects.\nFurthermore, the Bayesian framework enables the model to automatically\nfine-tune its predictions based on historical observations that might be\navailable on the test subject. We applied our method to a longitudinal\nAlzheimer's disease dataset with more than 3000 subjects [23] and present a\ndetailed empirical analysis of prediction performance under different\nscenarios, with comparisons against several benchmarks. We also demonstrate how\nthe proposed model can be interrogated to glean insights about temporal\ndynamics in Alzheimer's disease.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by complex and largely unknown\nprogression dynamics affecting the brain's morphology. Although the disease\nevolution spans decades, to date we cannot rely on long-term data to model the\npathological progression, since most of the available measures are on a\nshort-term scale. It is therefore difficult to understand and quantify the\ntemporal progression patterns affecting the brain regions across the AD\nevolution. In this work, we tackle this problem by presenting a generative\nmodel based on probabilistic matrix factorization across temporal and spatial\nsources. The proposed method addresses the problem of disease progression\nmodelling by introducing clinically-inspired statistical priors. To promote\nsmoothness in time and model plausible pathological evolutions, the temporal\nsources are defined as monotonic and independent Gaussian Processes. We also\nestimate an individual time-shift parameter for each patient to automatically\nposition him/her along the sources time-axis. To encode the spatial continuity\nof the brain sub-structures, the spatial sources are modeled as Gaussian random\nfields. We test our algorithm on grey matter maps extracted from brain\nstructural images. The experiments highlight differential temporal progression\npatterns mapping brain regions key to the AD pathology, and reveal a\ndisease-specific time scale associated with the decline of volumetric\nbiomarkers across clinical stages.",

Computations in PETNet are defined in\nnon-Euclidean, graph (network) domain, as it performs feature extraction by\nconvolution operations on spectral-filtered signals on the graph and pooling\noperations based on hierarchical graph clustering. Effectiveness of the PETNet\nis evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset,\nwhich shows improved performance over both deep learning and other machine\nlearning-based methods.",

To this end, recently\ndeveloped disease progression models can be used to perform early diagnosis, as\nwell as predict the subjects' disease stages and future evolution. However,\nthese models have not yet been applied to rare neurodegenerative diseases, are\nnot suitable to understand the complex dynamics of biomarkers, work only on\nlarge multimodal datasets, and their predictive performance has not been\nobjectively validated. In this work I developed novel models of disease\nprogression and applied them to estimate the progression of Alzheimer's disease\nand Posterior Cortical atrophy, a rare neurodegenerative syndrome causing\nvisual deficits. My first contribution is a study on the progression of\nPosterior Cortical Atrophy, using models already developed: the Event-based\nModel (EBM) and the Differential Equation Model (DEM). My second contribution\nis the development of DIVE, a novel spatio-temporal model of disease\nprogression that estimates fine-grained spatial patterns of pathology,\npotentially enabling us to understand complex disease mechanisms relating to\npathology propagation along brain networks. My third contribution is the\ndevelopment of Disease Knowledge Transfer (DKT), a novel disease progression\nmodel that estimates the multimodal progression of rare neurodegenerative\ndiseases from limited, unimodal datasets, by transferring information from\nlarger, multimodal datasets of typical neurodegenerative diseases. My fourth\ncontribution is the development of novel extensions for the EBM and the DEM,\nand the development of novel measures for performance evaluation of such\nmodels.

        "summary": "Discriminating patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from healthy subjects\nis a crucial task in the research of Alzheimer's disease. The task can be\npotentially achieved by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which is one of the\nmost classical and popular classification techniques. However, the\nclassification problem becomes challenging for LDA because of the\nhigh-dimensionally and the spatial dependency of the brain imaging data. To\naddress the challenges, researchers have proposed various ways to generalize\nLDA into high-dimensional context in recent years. However, these existing\nmethods did not reach any consensus on how to incorporate spatially dependent\nstructure. In light of the current needs and limitations, we propose a new\nclassification method, named as Penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation LDA\n(PMLE-LDA). The proposed method uses $Mat\\acute{e}rn$ covariance function to\ndescribe the spatial correlation of brain regions. Additionally, PMLE is\ndesigned to model the sparsity of high-dimensional features. The spatial\nlocation information is used to address the singularity of the covariance.\nTapering technique is introduced to reduce computational burden. We show in\ntheory that the proposed method can not only provide consistent results of\nparameter estimation and feature selection, but also generate an asymptotically\noptimal classifier driven by high dimensional data with specific spatially\ndependent structure. Finally, the method is validated through simulations and\nan application into ADNI data for classifying Alzheimer's patients.",

We model these processes by a system of\nSmoluchowski equations for the Amyloid beta concentration, an evolution\nequation for the dynamics of tau protein and a kinetic-type transport equation\nfor the distribution function of the degree of malfunctioning of neurons. The\nlatter equation contains an integral term describing the random onset of the\ndisease as a jump process localized in particularly sensitive areas of the\nbrain. We are particularly interested in investigating the effects of the\nsynergistic interplay of Amyloid beta and tau on the dynamics of Alzheimer's\ndisease. The output of our numerical simulations, although in 2D with an\nover-simplified geometry, is in good qualitative agreement with clinical\nfindings concerning both the disease distribution in the brain, which varies\nfrom early to advanced stages, and the effects of tau on the dynamics of the\ndisease.",

This phenomenon also serves\nas a valuable data source for quantitative methodological researchers\ndeveloping new approaches for classification. However, the growth of machine\nlearning (ML) approaches for classification may falsely lead many clinical\nresearchers to underestimate the value of logistic regression (LR), yielding\nequivalent or superior classification accuracy over other ML methods. Further,\nin applications with many features that could be used for classifying the\ntransition, clinical researchers are often unaware of the relative value of\ndifferent selection procedures. In the present study, we sought to investigate\nthe use of automated and theoretically-guided feature selection techniques, and\nas well as the L-1 norm when applying different classification techniques for\npredicting conversion from MCI to AD in a highly characterized and studied\nsample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We propose\nan alternative pre-selection technique that utilizes an efficient feature\nselection based on clinical knowledge of brain regions involved in AD. The\npresent findings demonstrate how similar performance can be achieved using\nuser-guided pre-selection versus algorithmic feature selection techniques.\nFinally, we compare the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) with that\nof logistic regression on multi-modal data from ADNI. The present findings show\nthat although SVM and other ML techniques are capable of relatively accurate\nclassification, similar or higher accuracy can often be achieved by LR,\nmitigating SVM's necessity or value for many clinical researchers.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and\nrecently attracts extensive attention worldwide. Speech technology is\nconsidered a promising solution for the early diagnosis of AD and has been\nenthusiastically studied. Most recent works concentrate on the use of advanced\nBERT-like classifiers for AD detection. Input to these classifiers are speech\ntranscripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. The major\nchallenge is that the quality of transcription could degrade significantly\nunder complex acoustic conditions in the real world. The detection performance,\nin consequence, is largely limited. This paper tackles the problem via\ntailoring and adapting pre-trained neural-network based ASR model for the\ndownstream AD recognition task. Only bottom layers of the ASR model are\nretained. A simple fully-connected neural network is added on top of the\ntailored ASR model for classification. The heavy BERT classifier is discarded.\nThe resulting model is light-weight and can be fine-tuned in an end-to-end\nmanner for AD recognition. Our proposed approach takes only raw speech as\ninput, and no extra transcription process is required. The linguistic\ninformation of speech is implicitly encoded in the tailored ASR model and\ncontributes to boosting the performance. Experiments show that our proposed\napproach outperforms the best manual transcript-based RoBERTa by an absolute\nmargin of 4.6% in terms of accuracy. Our best-performing models achieve the\naccuracy of 83.2% and 78.0% in the long-audio and short-audio competition\ntracks of the 2021 NCMMSC Alzheimer's Disease Recognition Challenge,\nrespectively.",

It is projected that by 2050, the number of people affected by\nthe disease would more than double. Consequently, the growing advancements in\ntechnology beg the question, can technology be used to predict Alzheimer's for\na better and early diagnosis? In this paper, we focus on this very problem.\nSpecifically, we have trained both ML models and neural networks to predict and\nclassify participants based on their speech patterns. We computed a number of\nlinguistic variables using DementiaBank's Pitt Corpus, a database consisting of\ntranscripts of interviews with subjects suffering from multiple\nneurodegenerative diseases. We then trained both binary classifiers, as well as\nmulticlass classifiers to distinguish AD from normal aging and other\nneurodegenerative diseases. We also worked on establishing the link between\nspecific speech factors that can help determine the onset of AD. Confusion\nmatrices and feature importance graphs have been plotted model-wise to compare\nthe performances of our models. In both multiclass and binary classification,\nneural networks were found to outperform the other models with a testing\naccuracy of 76.44% and 92.05% respectively.

In\nthis study, we carried out a meta-analysis of RNA-Seq studies for three\nneurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) to minimize the batch effect derived\ndifferences and identify the similarly altered factors among studies.

For this purpose, we downloaded publicly available Alzheimer's disease\n(84 patients + 33 controls = 117 individuals), Parkinson's disease (28 patients\n+ 43 controls = 71 individuals) and ALS (2 studies: 46 patients + 25 control =\n71 individuals) RNA-Seq data from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database.

These models include the BERT base model,\nPubMedBERT(abstracts + full text), PubMedBERT(only abstracts), Unified Medical\nLanguage System (UMLS) BERT, Bio BERT, and Bio-clinical BERT. We performed two\ncase studies: physical activity and excessive diet, in order to validate the\neffectiveness of BERT models in classifying lifestyle factors for AD.

The PubmedBERT(Abs) model achieved the best performance for\nphysical activity, with its precision, recall, and F-1 scores of 0.96, 0.96,\nand 0.96, respectively.

We focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD), where\nmagnetic resonance imaging scans provide information about the disease status.\nBy combining imaging with genome sequencing, we aim at identifying rare genetic\nmarkers associated with quantitative traits predicted from convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs), which traditionally have been derived manually by experts.\nKernel-based tests are a powerful tool for associating sets of genetic\nvariants, but how to optimally model rare genetic variants is still an open\nresearch question. We propose a generalized set of kernels that incorporate\nprior information from various annotations and multi-omics data.

        "summary": "Introduction: It is challenging at baseline to predict when and which\nindividuals who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will\nultimately progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Methods: A deep\nlearning method is developed and validated based on MRI scans of 2146 subjects\n(803 for training and 1343 for validation) to predict MCI subjects' progression\nto AD dementia in a time-to-event analysis setting. Results: The deep learning\ntime-to-event model predicted individual subjects' progression to AD dementia\nwith a concordance index (C-index) of 0.762 on 439 ADNI testing MCI subjects\nwith follow-up duration from 6 to 78 months (quartiles: [24, 42, 54]) and a\nC-index of 0.781 on 40 AIBL testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from\n18-54 months (quartiles: [18, 36,54]). The predicted progression risk also\nclustered individual subjects into subgroups with significant differences in\ntheir progression time to AD dementia (p<0.0002). Improved performance for\npredicting progression to AD dementia (C-index=0.864) was obtained when the\ndeep learning based progression risk was combined with baseline clinical\nmeasures. Conclusion: Our method provides a cost effective and accurate means\nfor prognosis and potentially to facilitate enrollment in clinical trials with\nindividuals likely to progress within a specific temporal period.",

        "summary": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is now regarded as the gold standard for\nthe diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, PET imaging can be\nprohibitive in terms of cost and planning, and is also among the imaging\ntechniques with the highest dosage of radiation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI), in contrast, is more widely available and provides more flexibility when\nsetting the desired image resolution. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of AD using\nMRI is difficult due to the very subtle physiological differences between\nhealthy and AD subjects visible on MRI. As a result, many attempts have been\nmade to synthesize PET images from MR images using generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) in the interest of enabling the diagnosis of AD from MR.\nExisting work on PET synthesis from MRI has largely focused on Conditional\nGANs, where MR images are used to generate PET images and subsequently used for\nAD diagnosis. There is no end-to-end training goal. This paper proposes an\nalternative approach to the aforementioned, where AD diagnosis is incorporated\nin the GAN training objective to achieve the best AD classification\nperformance. Different GAN lossesare fine-tuned based on the discriminator\nperformance, and the overall training is stabilized. The proposed network\narchitecture and training regime show state-of-the-art performance for three-\nand four- class AD classification tasks.",

However,\nin practice, one top methodological challenge hindering the heterogeneity\ninvestigation is that the true subgroup membership of each individual is often\nunknown. In this article, we aim to identify latent subgroups of individuals\nwho share a common disorder progress over time, to predict latent subgroup\nmemberships, and to estimate and infer the heterogeneous trajectories among the\nsubgroups. To achieve these goals, we apply a concave fusion learning method\nproposed in Ma and Huang (2017) and Ma et al. (2019) to conduct subgroup\nanalysis for longitudinal trajectories of the Alzheimer's disease data. The\nheterogeneous trajectories are represented by subject-specific unknown\nfunctions which are approximated by B-splines. The concave fusion method can\nsimultaneously estimate the spline coefficients and merge them together for the\nsubjects belonging to the same subgroup to automatically identify subgroups and\nrecover the heterogeneous trajectories. The resulting estimator of the disease\ntrajectory of each subgroup is supported by an asymptotic distribution. It\nprovides a sound theoretical basis for further conducting statistical inference\nin subgroup analysis..",

However, most machine learning approaches developed for\nprediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality\nmodels, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task\nlearning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are\ntrained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to\nother cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to\npredict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data\nfrom multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI\nfeatures from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities,\nincluding clinical and demographic information, to predict the future\ntrajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the\nstudy-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In\naddition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is\napplied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained\nand tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results.\nOur results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the\nbaseline models, and 2) models using extracted neuroimaging features from 3D\nconvolutional neural network outperform the same models when applied to\nMRI-derived volumetric features.",

        "summary": "Purpose: Hard-to-interpret Black-box Machine Learning (ML) were often used\nfor early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection.\n  Methods: To interpret eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest\n(RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) black-box models a workflow based on\nShapley values was developed. All models were trained on the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and evaluated for an independent\nADNI test set, as well as the external Australian Imaging and Lifestyle\nflagship study of Ageing (AIBL), and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies\n(OASIS) datasets. Shapley values were compared to intuitively interpretable\nDecision Trees (DTs), and Logistic Regression (LR), as well as natural and\npermutation feature importances. To avoid the reduction of the explanation\nvalidity caused by correlated features, forward selection and aspect\nconsolidation were implemented.\n  Results: Some black-box models outperformed DTs and LR. The forward-selected\nfeatures correspond to brain areas previously associated with AD. Shapley\nvalues identified biologically plausible associations with moderate to strong\ncorrelations with feature importances. The most important RF features to\npredict AD conversion were the volume of the amygdalae, and a cognitive test\nscore. Good cognitive test performances and large brain volumes decreased the\nAD risk. The models trained using cognitive test scores significantly\noutperformed brain volumetric models ($p<0.05$). Cognitive Normal (CN) vs. AD\nmodels were successfully transferred to external datasets.\n  Conclusion: In comparison to previous work, improved performances for ADNI\nand AIBL were achieved for CN vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)\nclassification using brain volumes. The Shapley values and the feature\nimportances showed moderate to strong correlations.",

Feature selection is often used\nto identify the important features but can produce unstable results when\napplied to high-dimensional data, selecting a different set of features on each\niteration.\n  The stability of feature selection can be improved with the use of feature\nselection ensembles, which aggregate the results of multiple base feature\nselectors. A threshold must be applied to the final aggregated feature set to\nseparate the relevant features from the redundant ones. A fixed threshold,\nwhich is typically applied, offers no guarantee that the final set of selected\nfeatures contains only relevant features. This work develops several\ndata-driven thresholds to automatically identify the relevant features in an\nensemble feature selector and evaluates their predictive accuracy and\nstability.\n  To demonstrate the applicability of these methods to clinical data, they are\napplied to data from two real-world Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies. AD is a\nprogressive neurodegenerative disease with no known cure, that begins at least\n2-3 decades before overt symptoms appear, presenting an opportunity for\nresearchers to identify early biomarkers that might identify patients at risk\nof developing AD.

However, existing statistical inference\napproaches of AD subtype identification ignore the pathological domain\nknowledge, which could lead to ill-posed results that are sometimes\ninconsistent with the essential neurological principles. Integrating systems\nbiology modeling with machine learning, we propose a novel pathology steered\nstratification network (PSSN) that incorporates established domain knowledge in\nAD pathology through a reaction-diffusion model, where we consider non-linear\ninteractions between major biomarkers and diffusion along brain structural\nnetwork. Trained on longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging data, the biological\nmodel predicts long-term trajectories that capture individual progression\npattern, filling in the gaps between sparse imaging data available. A deep\npredictive neural network is then built to exploit spatiotemporal dynamics,\nlink neurological examinations with clinical profiles, and generate subtype\nassignment probability on an individual basis. We further identify an\nevolutionary disease graph to quantify subtype transition probabilities through\nextensive simulations. Our stratification achieves superior performance in both\ninter-cluster heterogeneity and intra-cluster homogeneity of various clinical\nscores. Applying our approach to enriched samples of aging populations, we\nidentify six subtypes spanning AD spectrum, where each subtype exhibits a\ndistinctive biomarker pattern that is consistent with its clinical outcome.\nPSSN provides insights into pre-symptomatic diagnosis and practical guidance on\nclinical treatments, which may be further generalized to other\nneurodegenerative diseases.",

Characterizing cognitive decline in the\npreclinical phase of AD is critical for the development of early intervention\nstrategies when disease-modifying therapies may be most effective. In the last\ndecade, there has been an increased interest in the application of change point\n(CP) models to longitudinal cognitive outcomes. Because patients' change points\ncan vary greatly, it is essential to model this variation. In this paper, we\nintroduce a BAyesian Bent-Line Regression model longitudinal data on cognitive\nfunction in middle-aged adults with a high risk of AD. We provide an approach\nfor estimating the fixed (group-level) and random (person-level) CPs, slopes\npre- and post-CP, and intercepts at CP for cognition. Our model not only\nestimates the individual cognitive trajectories but also the distributions of\nthe cognitive bent line curves at each age, enabling researchers and clinicians\nto estimate subjects' quantiles. Simulation studies show that the estimation\nand inferential procedures perform reasonably well in finite samples.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are common forms of\nneurodegenerative dementia. Behavioral alterations and cognitive impairments\nare found in the clinical courses of both diseases and their differential\ndiagnosis is sometimes difficult for physicians. Therefore, an accurate tool\ndedicated to this diagnostic challenge can be valuable in clinical practice.\nHowever, current structural imaging methods mainly focus on the detection of\neach disease but rarely on their differential diagnosis. In this paper, we\npropose a deep learning based approach for both problems of disease detection\nand differential diagnosis. We suggest utilizing two types of biomarkers for\nthis application: structure grading and structure atrophy. First, we propose to\ntrain a large ensemble of 3D U-Nets to locally determine the anatomical\npatterns of healthy people, patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with\nFrontotemporal dementia using structural MRI as input. The output of the\nensemble is a 2-channel disease's coordinate map able to be transformed into a\n3D grading map which is easy to interpret for clinicians. This 2-channel map is\ncoupled with a multi-layer perceptron classifier for different classification\ntasks. Second, we propose to combine our deep learning framework with a\ntraditional machine learning strategy based on volume to improve the model\ndiscriminative capacity and robustness. After both cross-validation and\nexternal validation, our experiments based on 3319 MRI demonstrated competitive\nresults of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods for both disease\ndetection and differential diagnosis.",

Whilst\nexisting prognosis techniques demonstrate potential results, they are highly\nlimited in terms of using a single modality. Most importantly, they fail in\nconsidering a key element for prognosis: not all features extracted at the\ncurrent moment may contribute to the prognosis prediction several years later.\nTo address the current drawbacks of the literature, we propose a novel\nhypergraph framework based on an information bottleneck strategy (HGIB).\nFirstly, our framework seeks to discriminate irrelevant information, and\ntherefore, solely focus on harmonising relevant information for future MCI\nconversion prediction e.g., two years later). Secondly, our model\nsimultaneously accounts for multi-modal data based on imaging and non-imaging\nmodalities. HGIB uses a hypergraph structure to represent the multi-modality\ndata and accounts for various data modality types. Thirdly, the key of our\nmodel is based on a new optimisation scheme. It is based on modelling the\nprinciple of information bottleneck into loss functions that can be integrated\ninto our hypergraph neural network. We demonstrate, through extensive\nexperiments on ADNI, that our proposed HGIB framework outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art hypergraph neural networks for Alzheimer's disease prognosis.\nWe showcase our model even under fewer labels.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prominent, worldwide, age-related\nneurodegenerative disease that currently has no systemic treatment. Strong\nevidence suggests that permeable amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers,\nastrogliosis and reactive astrocytosis cause neuronal damage in AD. A large\namount of Abeta is secreted by astrocytes, which contributes to the total Abeta\ndeposition in the brain. This suggests that astrocytes may also play a role in\nAD, leading to increased attention to their dynamics and associated mechanisms.\nTherefore, in the present study, we developed and evaluated novel stochastic\nmodels for Abeta growth using ADNI data to predict the effect of astrocytes on\nAD progression in a clinical trial. In the AD case, accurate prediction is\nrequired for a successful clinical treatment plan. Given that AD studies are\nobservational in nature and involve routine patient visits, stochastic models\nprovide a suitable framework for modelling AD. Using the approximate Bayesian\ncomputation (ABC) approach, the AD etiology may be modelled as a multi-state\ndisease process. As a result, we use this approach to examine the weak and\nstrong influence of astrocytes at multiple disease progression stages using\nADNI data from the baseline to 2-year visits for AD patients whose ages ranged\nfrom 50 to 90 years. Based on ADNI data, we discovered that the strong\nastrocyte effect (i.e., a higher concentration of astrocytes as compared to\nAbeta) could help to lower or clear the growth of Abeta, which is a key to\nslowing down AD progression.",

In recent works, AD\ndiagnosis has the primary assumption that all categories are known a prior -- a\nclosed-set classification problem, which contrasts with the open-set\nrecognition problem. This assumption hinders the application of the model in\nnatural clinical settings. Although many open-set recognition technologies have\nbeen proposed in other fields, they are challenging to use for AD diagnosis\ndirectly since 1) AD is a degenerative disease of the nervous system with\nsimilar symptoms at each stage, and it is difficult to distinguish from its\npre-state, and 2) diversified strategies for AD diagnosis are challenging to\nmodel uniformly. In this work, inspired by the concerns of clinicians during\ndiagnosis, we propose an open-set recognition model, OpenAPMax, based on the\nanomaly pattern to address AD diagnosis in real-world settings. OpenAPMax first\nobtains the abnormal pattern of each patient relative to each known category\nthrough statistics or a literature search, clusters the patients' abnormal\npattern, and finally, uses extreme value theory (EVT) to model the distance\nbetween each patient's abnormal pattern and the center of their category and\nmodify the classification probability.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are common types of\nneurodegenerative disorders that present overlapping clinical symptoms, making\ntheir differential diagnosis very challenging. Numerous efforts have been done\nfor the diagnosis of each disease but the problem of multi-class differential\ndiagnosis has not been actively explored. In recent years, transformer-based\nmodels have demonstrated remarkable success in various computer vision tasks.\nHowever, their use in disease diagnostic is uncommon due to the limited amount\nof 3D medical data given the large size of such models. In this paper, we\npresent a novel 3D transformer-based architecture using a deformable patch\nlocation module to improve the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease\nand Frontotemporal dementia. Moreover, to overcome the problem of data\nscarcity, we propose an efficient combination of various data augmentation\ntechniques, adapted for training transformer-based models on 3D structural\nmagnetic resonance imaging data. Finally, we propose to combine our\ntransformer-based model with a traditional machine learning model using brain\nstructure volumes to better exploit the available data. Our experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing competitive\nresults compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the deformable patch\nlocations can be visualized, revealing the most relevant brain regions used to\nestablish the diagnosis of each disease.",

        "summary": "The relationship between brain structure and function is critical for\nrevealing the pathogenesis of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease\n(AD). However, mapping brain structure to function connections is a very\nchallenging task. In this work, a bidirectional graph generative adversarial\nnetwork (BG-GAN) is proposed to represent brain structure-function connections.\nSpecifically, by designing a module incorporating inner graph convolution\nnetwork (InnerGCN), the generators of BG-GAN can employ features of direct and\nindirect brain regions to learn the mapping function between the structural\ndomain and the functional domain. Besides, a new module named Balancer is\ndesigned to counterpoise the optimization between generators and\ndiscriminators. By introducing the Balancer into BG-GAN, both the structural\ngenerator and functional generator can not only alleviate the issue of mode\ncollapse but also learn complementarity of structural and functional features.\nExperimental results using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\n(ADNI) dataset show that both generated structure and function connections can\nimprove the identification accuracy of AD. The experimental findings suggest\nthat the relationship between brain structure and function is not a complete\none-to-one correspondence.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease is a global health challenge that requires early and\naccurate detection to improve patient outcomes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) holds significant diagnostic potential, but its effective analysis\nremains a formidable task. This study introduces a groundbreaking decentralized\nexpert system that cleverly combines blockchain technology with Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) to integrate robust anomaly detection for patient-submitted\ndata.\n  Traditional diagnostic methods often lead to delayed and imprecise\npredictions, especially in the early stages of the disease. Centralized data\nrepositories struggle to manage the immense volumes of MRI data, and persistent\nprivacy concerns hinder collaborative efforts. Our innovative solution\nharnesses decentralization to protect data integrity and patient privacy,\nfacilitated by blockchain technology. It not only emphasizes AI-driven MRI\nanalysis but also incorporates a sophisticated data anomaly detection\narchitecture. These mechanisms scrutinize patient-contributed data for various\nissues, including data quality problems and atypical findings within MRI\nimages.\n  Conducting an exhaustive check of MRI image correctness and quality directly\non the blockchain is impractical due to computational complexity and cost\nconstraints. Typically, such checks are performed off-chain, and the blockchain\nsecurely records the results.

However, many\nof these methods are facing a trade-off that 3D models tend to be complicated\nwhile 2D models cannot capture the full 3D intricacies from the data. In this\npaper, we introduce a new model structure for diagnosing AD, and it can\ncomplete with performances of 3D models while essentially is a 2D method (thus\ncomputationally efficient). While the core idea lies in new perspective of\ncutting the 3D images into multiple 2D slices from three dimensions, we\nintroduce multiple components that can further benefit the model in this new\nperspective, including adaptively selecting the number of sclices in each\ndimension, and the new attention mechanism. In addition, we also introduce a\nmorphology augmentation, which also barely introduces new computational loads,\nbut can help improve the diagnosis performances due to its alignment to the\npathology of AD. We name our method ADAPT, which stands for Alzheimer Diagnosis\nthrough Adaptive Profiling Transformers.

        "summary": "Normative modeling has emerged as a pivotal approach for characterizing\nheterogeneity and individual variance in neurodegenerative diseases, notably\nAlzheimer's disease(AD). One of the challenges of cortical normative modeling\nis the anatomical structure mismatch due to folding pattern variability.\nTraditionally, registration is applied to address this issue and recently many\nstudies have utilized deep generative models to generate anatomically align\nsamples for analyzing disease progression; however, these models are\npredominantly applied to volume-based data, which often falls short in\ncapturing intricate morphological changes on the brain cortex. As an\nalternative, surface-based analysis has been proven to be more sensitive in\ndisease modeling such as AD, yet, like volume-based data, it also suffers from\nthe mismatch problem. To address these limitations, we proposed a novel\ngenerative normative modeling framework by transferring the conditional\ndiffusion generative model to the spherical non-Euclidean domain. Additionally,\nthis approach generates normal feature map distributions by explicitly\nconditioning on individual anatomical segmentation to ensure better geometrical\nalignment which helps to reduce anatomical variance between subjects in\nanalysis. We find that our model can generate samples that are better\nanatomically aligned than registered reference data and through ablation study\nand normative assessment experiments, the samples are able to better measure\nindividual differences from the normal distribution and increase sensitivity in\ndifferentiating cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) patients.",

Therefore, it is critical to capture\nthe disease progression in an early stage such that intervention can be applied\nbefore the onset of symptoms. Machine learning (ML) models have been shown\neffective in predicting the onset of AD. Yet for subjects with follow-up\nvisits, existing techniques for AD classification only aim for accurate group\nassignment, where the monotonically increasing risk across follow-up visits is\nusually ignored. Resulted fluctuating risk scores across visits violate the\nirreversibility of AD, hampering the trustworthiness of models and also\nproviding little value to understanding the disease progression. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel regularization approach to predict AD\nlongitudinally. Our technique aims to maintain the expected monotonicity of\nincreasing disease risk during progression while preserving expressiveness.\nSpecifically, we introduce a monotonicity constraint that encourages the model\nto predict disease risk in a consistent and ordered manner across follow-up\nvisits.

While most previous work has focused on\ncase-control data, the application of generative models to disorder-specific\ndatasets and their ability to preserve diagnostic patterns remain relatively\nunexplored. Hence, in this study, we investigated the use of a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to\ngenerate functional network connectivity (FNC) and T1-weighted structural\nmagnetic resonance imaging data from each other. We employed a cycle-GAN to\nsynthesize data in an unpaired data transition and enhanced the transition by\nintegrating weak supervision in cases where paired data were available. Our\nfindings revealed that our model could offer remarkable capability, achieving a\nstructural similarity index measure (SSIM) of $0.89 \\pm 0.003$ for T1s and a\ncorrelation of $0.71 \\pm 0.004$ for FNCs. Moreover, our qualitative analysis\nrevealed similar patterns between generated and actual data when comparing AD\nto cognitively normal (CN) individuals. In particular, we observed\nsignificantly increased functional connectivity in cerebellar-sensory motor and\ncerebellar-visual networks and reduced connectivity in cerebellar-subcortical,\nauditory-sensory motor, sensory motor-visual, and cerebellar-cognitive control\nnetworks.

From a\npreliminary analysis of complexes containing IL-3 and IL-3R, we hypothesized\nthat the binding is largely due to the interactions of three alpha helix\nstructures stretching towards the active site on the receptor. The original\nIl-3 protein serves as the control in this experiment; the other proteins being\ntested are generated through several types of computational de novo protein\ndesign, where machine learning allows for the production of entirely novel\nstructures. The efficacy of the generated proteins is assessed through docking\nsimulations with the IL-3R receptor, and the binding poses are also\nqualitatively examined to gain insight into the function of the binding.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder that leads\nto memory and behavior impairment severe enough to interfere with daily life\nactivities. Understanding this disease pathogenesis can drive the development\nof new targets and strategies to prevent and treat AD. Recent advances in\nhigh-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing technology (scRNA-seq) have enabled\nthe generation of massive amounts of transcriptomic data at the single-cell\nlevel provided remarkable insights into understanding the molecular\npathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we introduce ScAtt, an\ninnovative Attention-based architecture, devised specifically for the\nconcurrent identification of cell-type specific AD-related genes and their\nassociated gene regulatory network. ScAtt incorporates a flexible model capable\nof capturing nonlinear effects, leading to the detection of AD-associated genes\nthat might be overlooked by traditional differentially expressed gene (DEG)\nanalyses. Moreover, ScAtt effectively infers a gene regulatory network\ndepicting the combined influences of genes on the targeted disease, as opposed\nto examining correlations among genes in conventional gene co-expression\nnetworks. In an application to 95,186 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 17\nhippocampus samples, ScAtt shows substantially better performance in modeling\nquantitative changes in expression levels between AD and healthy controls.\nConsequently, ScAtt performs better than existing methods in the identification\nof AD-related genes, with more unique discoveries and less overlap between cell\ntypes. Functional enrichments of the corresponding gene modules detected from\ngene regulatory network show significant enrichment of biologically meaningful\nAD-related pathways across different cell types.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown promise in predicting\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) progression due to its unique ability to model domain\nknowledge. However, it is not clear which RL algorithms are well-suited for\nthis task. Furthermore, these methods are not inherently explainable, limiting\ntheir applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. Our work addresses these\ntwo important questions. Using a causal, interpretable model of AD, we first\ncompare the performance of four contemporary RL algorithms in predicting brain\ncognition over 10 years using only baseline (year 0) data. We then apply SHAP\n(SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain the decisions made by each algorithm\nin the model. Our approach combines interpretability with explainability to\nprovide insights into the key factors influencing AD progression, offering both\nglobal and individual, patient-level analysis. Our findings show that only one\nof the RL methods is able to satisfactorily model disease progression, but the\npost-hoc explanations indicate that all methods fail to properly capture the\nimportance of amyloid accumulation, one of the pathological hallmarks of\nAlzheimer's disease. Our work aims to merge predictive accuracy with\ntransparency, assisting clinicians and researchers in enhancing disease\nprogression modeling for informed healthcare decisions.

Finally,\nour method achieves an AUROC of 0.80 in detecting AD, out-performing several\nsupervised and unsupervised baselines.

Here we turn to\nconditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions\ngiven the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial\nimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a\nnovel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled\nfrom to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to\nextrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated\nthe model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open\nAccess Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we\nshow that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution.\nFurther, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage\nof our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In\npractice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide\na counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation.\nFurthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for\ndownstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.",

        "summary": "Deep learning methods have significantly advanced medical image segmentation,\nyet their success hinges on large volumes of manually annotated data, which\nrequire specialized expertise for accurate labeling. Additionally, these\nmethods often demand substantial computational resources, particularly for\nthree-dimensional medical imaging tasks. Consequently, applying deep learning\ntechniques for medical image segmentation with limited annotated data and\ncomputational resources remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose\na novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, termed HyPS, which employs a\nhybrid parallel and serial architecture. HyPS updates a minimal subset of model\nparameters, thereby retaining the pre-trained model's original knowledge\ntructure while enhancing its ability to learn specific features relevant to\ndownstream tasks. We apply this strategy to the state-of-the-art SwinUNETR\nmodel for medical image segmentation. Initially, the model is pre-trained on\nthe BraTs2021 dataset, after which the HyPS method is employed to transfer it\nto three distinct hippocampus datasets.Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nHyPS outperforms baseline methods, especially in scenarios with limited\ntraining samples. Furthermore, based on the segmentation results, we calculated\nthe hippocampal volumes of subjects from the ADNI dataset and combined these\nwith metadata to classify disease types. In distinguishing Alzheimer's disease\n(AD) from cognitively normal (CN) individuals, as well as early mild cognitive\nimpairment (EMCI) from late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), HyPS achieved\nclassification accuracies of 83.78% and 64.29%, respectively. These findings\nindicate that the HyPS method not only facilitates effective hippocampal\nsegmentation using pre-trained models but also holds potential for aiding\nAlzheimer's disease detection.

        "summary": "Different brain imaging modalities offer unique insights into brain function\nand structure. Combining them enhances our understanding of neural mechanisms.\nPrior multimodal studies fusing functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI)\nhave shown the benefits of this approach. Since sMRI lacks temporal data,\nexisting fusion methods often compress fMRI temporal information into summary\nmeasures, sacrificing rich temporal dynamics. Motivated by the observation that\ncovarying networks are identified in both sMRI and resting-state fMRI, we\ndeveloped a novel fusion method, by combining deep learning frameworks, copulas\nand independent component analysis (ICA), named copula linked parallel ICA\n(CLiP-ICA). This method estimates independent sources for each modality and\nlinks the spatial sources of fMRI and sMRI using a copula-based model for more\nflexible integration of temporal and spatial data. We tested CLiP-ICA using\ndata from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results\nshowed that CLiP-ICA effectively captures both strongly and weakly linked sMRI\nand fMRI networks, including the cerebellum, sensorimotor, visual, cognitive\ncontrol, and default mode networks. It revealed more meaningful components and\nfewer artifacts, addressing the long-standing issue of optimal model order in\nICA. CLiP-ICA also detected complex functional connectivity patterns across\nstages of cognitive decline, with cognitively normal subjects generally showing\nhigher connectivity in sensorimotor and visual networks compared to patients\nwith Alzheimer, along with patterns suggesting potential compensatory\nmechanisms.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits substantial clinical and biological\nheterogeneity, complicating efforts in treatment and intervention development.\nWhile new computational methods offer insights into AD progression, the\nreproducibility of these subtypes across datasets remains understudied,\nparticularly concerning the robustness of subtype definitions when validated on\ndiverse databases. This study evaluates the consistency of AD progression\nsubtypes identified by the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm\nusing T1-weighted MRI data across 5,444 subjects from ANMerge, OASIS, and ADNI\ndatasets, forming four independent cohorts. Each cohort was analyzed under two\nconditions: one using the full cohort, including cognitively normal controls,\nand another excluding controls to test subtype robustness. Results confirm the\nthree primary atrophy subtypes identified in earlier studies: Typical,\nCortical, and Subcortical, as well as the emergence of rare and atypical AD\nvariants such as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). Notably, each subtype\ndisplayed varying robustness to the inclusion of controls, with certain\nsubtypes, like Subcortical, more influenced by cohort composition. This\ninvestigation underscores SuStaIn's reliability for defining stable AD subtypes\nand suggests its utility in clinical stratification for trials and diagnosis.\nHowever, our findings also highlight the need for improved dataset diversity,\nparticularly in terms of ethnic representation, to enhance generalizability and\nsupport broader clinical application.",

        "summary": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for intervention\nbefore irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. Structural MRI (sMRI) is widely\nused for AD diagnosis, but conventional deep learning approaches primarily rely\non intensity-based features, which require large datasets to capture subtle\nstructural changes. Jacobian determinant maps (JSM) provide complementary\ninformation by encoding localized brain deformations, yet existing multimodal\nfusion strategies fail to fully integrate these features with sMRI. We propose\na cross-attention fusion framework to model the intrinsic relationship between\nsMRI intensity and JSM-derived deformations for AD classification. Using the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we compare\ncross-attention, pairwise self-attention, and bottleneck attention with four\npre-trained 3D image encoders. Cross-attention fusion achieves superior\nperformance, with mean ROC-AUC scores of 0.903 (+/-0.033) for AD vs.\ncognitively normal (CN) and 0.692 (+/-0.061) for mild cognitive impairment\n(MCI) vs. CN. Despite its strong performance, our model remains highly\nefficient, with only 1.56 million parameters--over 40 times fewer than\nResNet-34 (63M) and Swin UNETR (61.98M).

Using GPT-4o, we created a simulated\nresearch team of LLM-based autonomous agents tasked with writing and executing\ncode to dynamically reproduce the findings of each study, given only study\nAbstracts, Methods sections, and data dictionary descriptions of the dataset.\n  Results: We extracted 35 key findings described in the Abstracts across 5\nAlzheimer's studies. On average, LLM agents approximately reproduced 53.2% of\nfindings per study. Numeric values and range-based findings often differed\nbetween studies and agents. The agents also applied statistical methods or\nparameters that varied from the originals, though overall trends and\nsignificance were sometimes similar.\n  Discussion: In some cases, LLM-based agents replicated research techniques\nand findings. In others, they failed due to implementation flaws or missing\nmethodological detail. These discrepancies show the current limits of LLMs in\nfully automating reproducibility assessments. Still, this early investigation\nhighlights the potential of structured agent-based systems to provide scalable\nevaluation of scientific rigor.\n  Conclusion: This exploratory work illustrates both the promise and\nlimitations of LLMs as autonomous agents for automating reproducibility in\nbiomedical research.",

        "summary": "This paper is motivated by the heterogeneous associations among demographic\ncovariates, imaging data, and cognitive performances across different\ndiagnostic groups within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)\nstudy. We propose a novel PArtially-shared Imaging Regression (PAIR) model with\nsmooth spatial component integration to capture heterogeneous imaging\ncoefficients across multiple data sources. The model assumes that each imaging\ncoefficient can be represented as a weighted combination of a set of smooth\nspatial components. Additionally, we apply a Total Variation (TV) penalty on\neach component to capture complex spatial patterns and introduce a Selective\nIntegration Penalty (SIP) to adaptively learn the degree of partial-sharing\namong imaging coefficients. Applied to ADNI data, PAIR significantly improves\npredictive performance and uncovers distinct heterogeneous relationships. After\nadjusting for demographic covariates, hippocampal imaging minimally contributes\nto cognitive scores in the cognitively normal (CN) group but substantially in\nthe cognitively impaired (CI) group. Furthermore, the effects of demographic\ncovariates on cognitive scores remain stable among CN participants yet change\nnotably for CI participants after imaging adjustment, suggesting hippocampal\nstructural modulation. Imaging coefficient analysis reveals weak hippocampal\nsignals in CN subjects, whereas prominent positive signals in CA1, CA3, and\npresubiculum subfields characterize the CI group. These analyses facilitate\nfurther investigation into functional mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease\n(AD) progression.",

        "summary": "Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge\nsources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI\nsystems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited\nadaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized\nexternal knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that\norchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide\ncomprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based\narchitecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools\nwithout altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and\ntraceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each\nintermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch\nacross three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,\nchest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using\nauthentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive\nperformance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease\ndiagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the\nstate-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting\nAlzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a\nsignificant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior\nperformance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover,\nin complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves\nan accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance\nhealthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal\nmedical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical\ndecision-making.",

Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic\nmarkers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.\nFoundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce\nhigh-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.\n  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio\nrecordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy\ncontrol (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We\nexcluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final\ndataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases.

        "summary": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's\nDisease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow\nthe progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates\nconfounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the\noutstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The\nstudy showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal\nlearning for neurological disease diagnosis.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that\npredominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is\nessential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial\nand frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain\nand reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most\nexisting AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting\ntheir capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the\ndisease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information,\nthey are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain\nanalysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose\nSpatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework\nthat simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to\nenhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense\nconvolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency\nmodule to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a\nnovel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial\nfeature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines\nand reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and\nAD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.",

Traditional diagnostic methods,\ntypically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the\nmultifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from\nthree primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This\nframework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and\nbiomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by\naggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques\nlike weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not\nonly improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the\nidentification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage\nover conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is\nparticularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of\nclinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially\naltering the course of the disease.

        "summary": "We describe a new method to automatically discriminate between patients with\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly\ncontrols, based on multidimensional classification of hippocampal shape\nfeatures. This approach uses spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients to model\nthe shape of the hippocampi, which are segmented from magnetic resonance images\n(MRI) using a fully automatic method that we previously developed. SPHARM\ncoefficients are used as features in a classification procedure based on\nsupport vector machines (SVM). The most relevant features for classification\nare selected using a bagging strategy. We evaluate the accuracy of our method\nin a group of 23 patients with AD (10 males, 13 females, age $\\pm$\nstandard-deviation (SD) = 73 $\\pm$ 6 years, mini-mental score (MMS) = 24.4\n$\\pm$ 2.8), 23 patients with amnestic MCI (10 males, 13 females, age $\\pm$ SD =\n74 $\\pm$ 8 years, MMS = 27.3 $\\pm$ 1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13\nmales, 12 females, age $\\pm$ SD = 64 $\\pm$ 8 years), using leave-one-out\ncross-validation. For AD vs controls, we obtain a correct classification rate\nof 94%, a sensitivity of 96%, and a specificity of 92%. For MCI vs controls, we\nobtain a classification rate of 83%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of\n84%. This accuracy is superior to that of hippocampal volumetry and is\ncomparable to recently published SVM-based whole-brain classification methods,\nwhich relied on a different strategy. This new method may become a useful tool\nto assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",

Volumetric imaging approaches, such as multiphoton\nmicroscopy, are able to generate detailed 3D images of blood vessels that could\ncontribute to our understanding of the role of vascular structure in normal\nphysiology and in disease mechanisms. The segmentation of vessels, a core image\nanalysis problem, is a bottleneck that has prevented the systematic comparison\nof 3D vascular architecture across experimental populations. We explored the\nuse of convolutional neural networks to segment 3D vessels within volumetric in\nvivo images acquired by multiphoton microscopy. We evaluated different network\narchitectures and machine learning techniques in the context of this\nsegmentation problem. We show that our optimized convolutional neural network\narchitecture, which we call DeepVess, yielded a segmentation accuracy that was\nbetter than both the current state-of-the-art and a trained human annotator,\nwhile also being orders of magnitude faster. To explore the effects of aging\nand Alzheimer's disease on capillaries, we applied DeepVess to 3D images of\ncortical blood vessels in young and old mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and\nwild type littermates. We found little difference in the distribution of\ncapillary diameter or tortuosity between these groups, but did note a decrease\nin the number of longer capillary segments ($>75\\mu m$) in aged animals as\ncompared to young, in both wild type and Alzheimer's disease mouse models.",

We intend to take advantage of this\nsituation and apply this technology in solving real world problems. There was a\nneed for automatic diagnosis certain diseases from medical images that could\nhelp a doctor and radiologist for further action towards treating the illness.\nWe chose Alzheimer disease for this purpose. Alzheimer disease is the leading\ncause of dementia and memory loss. Alzheimer disease, it is caused by atrophy\nof the certain brain regions and by brain cell death. MRI scans reveal this\ninformation but atrophy regions are different for different people which makes\nthe diagnosis a little trickier and often gets miss-diagnosed by doctors and\nradiologists. The Dataset used for this project is provided by OASIS, which\ncontains over 400 subjects 100 of which having mild to severe dementia and is\nsupplemented by MMSE and CDR standards of diagnosis in the same context. Enter\nCNN, Convolutional Neural Networks are a hybrid of Kernel Convolutions and\nNeural Networks. Kernel Convolutions is a technique that uses filters to\nrecognize and segment images based on features. Neural Networks consist of\nneurons which are loosely based on human brains neuron which represents a\nsingle classifier and interconnected by weights, have different biases and are\nactivated by some activation functions.

        "summary": "In this study we propose a deformation-based framework to jointly model the\ninfluence of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the brain morphological\nevolution. Our approach combines a spatio-temporal description of both\nprocesses into a generative model. A reference morphology is deformed along\nspecific trajectories to match subject specific morphologies. It is used to\ndefine two imaging progression markers: 1) a morphological age and 2) a disease\nscore. These markers can be computed locally in any brain region. The approach\nis evaluated on brain structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the ADNI\ndatabase. The generative model is first estimated on a control population,\nthen, for each subject, the markers are computed for each acquisition. The\nlongitudinal evolution of these markers is then studied in relation with the\nclinical diagnosis of the subjects and used to generate possible morphological\nevolution. In the model, the morphological changes associated with normal aging\nare mainly found around the ventricles, while the Alzheimer's disease specific\nchanges are more located in the temporal lobe and the hippocampal area. The\nstatistical analysis of these markers highlights differences between clinical\nconditions even though the inter-subject variability is quiet high. In this\ncontext, the model can be used to generate plausible morphological trajectories\nassociated with the disease. Our method gives two interpretable scalar imaging\nbiomarkers assessing the effects of aging and disease on brain morphology at\nthe individual and population level. These markers confirm an acceleration of\napparent aging for Alzheimer's subjects and can help discriminate clinical\nconditions even in prodromal stages. More generally, the joint modeling of\nnormal and pathological evolutions shows promising results to describe\nage-related brain diseases over long time scales.",

Robustness of the estimates is quantified using\nbootstrapping via Monte Carlo resampling, and the estimated inflection points\nof the fitted functions are used to temporally order the modeled biomarkers in\nthe disease course. Kernel density estimation is applied to the obtained DPSs\nfor clinical status classification using a Bayesian classifier. Different\nM-estimators and logistic functions, including a novel type proposed in this\nstudy, called modified Stannard, are evaluated on the data from the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for robust modeling of volumetric MRI\nand PET biomarkers, CSF measurements, as well as cognitive tests. The results\nshow that the modified Stannard function fitted using the logistic loss\nachieves the best modeling performance with an average normalized MAE of 0.991\nacross all biomarkers and bootstraps. Applied to the ADNI test set, this model\nachieves a multiclass AUC of 0.934 in clinical status classification. The\nobtained results for the proposed model outperform almost all state-of-the-art\nresults in predicting biomarker values and classifying clinical status.\nFinally, the experiments show that the proposed model, trained using abundant\nADNI data, generalizes well to data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating\nCenter (NACC) with an average normalized MAE of 1.182 and a multiclass AUC of\n0.929.",

Automatic segmentation is an active research field, with many recent\nmodels using deep learning. Most current state-of-the art hippocampus\nsegmentation methods train their methods on healthy or Alzheimer's disease\npatients from public datasets. This raises the question whether these methods\nare capable of recognizing the hippocampus on a different domain, that of\nepilepsy patients with hippocampus resection. In this paper we present a\nstate-of-the-art, open source, ready-to-use, deep learning based hippocampus\nsegmentation method. It uses an extended 2D multi-orientation approach, with\nautomatic pre-processing and orientation alignment. The methodology was\ndeveloped and validated using HarP, a public Alzheimer's disease hippocampus\nsegmentation dataset. We test this methodology alongside other recent deep\nlearning methods, in two domains: The HarP test set and an in-house epilepsy\ndataset, containing hippocampus resections, named HCUnicamp. We show that our\nmethod, while trained only in HarP, surpasses others from the literature in\nboth the HarP test set and HCUnicamp in Dice. Additionally, Results from\ntraining and testing in HCUnicamp volumes are also reported separately,\nalongside comparisons between training and testing in epilepsy and Alzheimer's\ndata and vice versa. Although current state-of-the-art methods, including our\nown, achieve upwards of 0.9 Dice in HarP, all tested methods, including our\nown, produced false positives in HCUnicamp resection regions, showing that\nthere is still room for improvement for hippocampus segmentation methods when\nresection is involved.",

Strong points\nof the challenge are that the test data did not exist at the time of\nforecasting (it was acquired afterwards), and that it focuses on the\nchallenging problem of cohort selection for clinical trials by identifying fast\nprogressors. The submission phase of TADPOLE was open until 15 November 2017;\nsince then data has been acquired until April 2019 from 219 subjects with 223\nclinical visits and 150 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, which was used\nfor the evaluation of the participants' predictions.

For diagnosis prediction, the best forecast\n(team Frog), which was based on gradient boosting, obtained a multiclass area\nunder the receiver-operating curve (MAUC) of 0.931, while for ventricle\nprediction the best forecast (team EMC1), which was based on disease\nprogression modelling and spline regression, obtained mean absolute error of\n0.41% of total intracranial volume (ICV). For ADAS-Cog 13, no forecast was\nconsiderably better than the benchmark mixed effects model (BenchmarkME),\nprovided to participants before the submission deadline.

        "title": "AD-Lite Net: A Lightweight and Concatenated CNN Model for Alzheimer's\n  Detection from MRI Images",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a non-curable progressive neurodegenerative\ndisorder that affects the human brain, leading to a decline in memory,\ncognitive abilities, and eventually, the ability to carry out daily tasks.\nManual diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images is fraught with less\nsensitivity and it is a very tedious process for neurologists. Therefore, there\nis a need for an automatic Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) system, which can\ndetect AD at early stages with higher accuracy. In this research, we have\nproposed a novel AD-Lite Net model (trained from scratch), that could alleviate\nthe aforementioned problem. The novelties we bring here in this research are,\n(I) We have proposed a very lightweight CNN model by incorporating Depth Wise\nSeparable Convolutional (DWSC) layers and Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers.\n(II) We have leveraged a ``parallel concatenation block'' (pcb), in the\nproposed AD-Lite Net model. This pcb consists of a Transformation layer\n(Tx-layer), followed by two convolutional layers, which are thereby\nconcatenated with the original base model. This Tx-layer converts the features\ninto very distinct kind of features, which are imperative for the Alzheimer's\ndisease. As a consequence, the proposed AD-Lite Net model with ``parallel\nconcatenation'' converges faster and automatically mitigates the class\nimbalance problem from the MRI datasets in a very generalized way. For the\nvalidity of our proposed model, we have implemented it on three different MRI\ndatasets. Furthermore, we have combined the ADNI and AD datasets and\nsubsequently performed a 10-fold cross-validation experiment to verify the\nmodel's generalization ability. Extensive experimental results showed that our\nproposed model has outperformed all the existing CNN models, and one recent\ntrend Vision Transformer (ViT) model by a significant margin.",

        "summary": "Identifying amyloid-beta positive patients is crucial for determining\neligibility for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials and new\ndisease-modifying treatments, but currently requires PET or CSF sampling.\nPrevious MRI-based deep learning models for predicting amyloid positivity,\nusing only T1w sequences, have shown moderate performance. We trained deep\nlearning models to predict amyloid PET positivity and evaluated whether\nmulti-contrast inputs improve performance. A total of 4,058 exams with\nmulti-contrast MRI and PET-based quantitative amyloid deposition were obtained\nfrom three public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\n(ADNI), the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS3), and the\nAnti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4). Two separate\nEfficientNet models were trained for amyloid positivity prediction: one with\nonly T1w images and the other with both T1w and T2-FLAIR images as network\ninputs. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity\nwere determined using an internal held-out test set. The trained models were\nfurther evaluated using an external test set. In the held-out test sets, the\nT1w and T1w+T2FLAIR models demonstrated AUCs of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.64) and\n0.67 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.70) (p = 0.006); accuracies were 61% (95% CI: 60%, 63%)\nand 64% (95% CI: 62%, 66%) (p = 0.008); sensitivities were 0.88 and 0.71; and\nspecificities were 0.23 and 0.53, respectively. The trained models showed\nsimilar performance in the external test set. Performance of the current model\non both test sets exceeded that of the publicly available model. In conclusion,\nthe use of multi-contrast MRI, specifically incorporating T2-FLAIR in addition\nto T1w images, significantly improved the predictive accuracy of PET-determined\namyloid status from MRI scans using a deep learning approach.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating multiple graphical\nmodels simultaneously using the fused lasso penalty, which encourages adjacent\ngraphs to share similar structures. A motivating example is the analysis of\nbrain networks of Alzheimer's disease using neuroimaging data. Specifically, we\nmay wish to estimate a brain network for the normal controls (NC), a brain\nnetwork for the patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a brain\nnetwork for Alzheimer's patients (AD). We expect the two brain networks for NC\nand MCI to share common structures but not to be identical to each other;\nsimilarly for the two brain networks for MCI and AD. The proposed formulation\ncan be solved using a second-order method. Our key technical contribution is to\nestablish the necessary and sufficient condition for the graphs to be\ndecomposable. Based on this key property, a simple screening rule is presented,\nwhich decomposes the large graphs into small subgraphs and allows an efficient\nestimation of multiple independent (small) subgraphs, dramatically reducing the\ncomputational cost. We perform experiments on both synthetic and real data; our\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

However,\nthe general case of limited training samples, as well as different feature\nrepresentations typically makes this problem challenging. In this work, we\npropose a novel multiple kernel learning framework to combine multi-modal\nfeatures for AD classification, which is scalable and easy to implement.\nContrary to the usual way of solving the problem in the dual space, we look at\nthe optimization from a new perspective. By conducting Fourier transform on the\nGaussian kernel, we explicitly compute the mapping function, which leads to a\nmore straightforward solution of the problem in the primal space. Furthermore,\nwe impose the mixed $L_{21}$ norm constraint on the kernel weights, known as\nthe group lasso regularization, to enforce group sparsity among different\nfeature modalities. This actually acts as a role of feature modality selection,\nwhile at the same time exploiting complementary information among different\nkernels. Therefore it is able to extract the most discriminative features for\nclassification. Experiments on the ADNI data set demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method.",

We model these two processes by a system of\nSmoluchowski equations for the amyloid concentration, coupled to a kinetic-type\ntransport equation for the distribution function of the degree of\nmalfunctioning of neurons.

        "summary": "Medical imaging studies have collected high dimensional imaging data to\nidentify imaging biomarkers for diagnosis, screening, and prognosis, among many\nothers. These imaging data are often represented in the form of a\nmulti-dimensional array, called a tensor. The aim of this paper is to develop a\ntensor partition regression modeling (TPRM) framework to establish a\nrelationship between low-dimensional clinical outcomes (e.g., diagnosis) and\nhigh dimensional tensor covariates. Our TPRM is a hierarchical model and\nefficiently integrates four components: (i) a partition model, (ii) a canonical\npolyadic decomposition model, (iii) a principal components model, and (iv) a\ngeneralized linear model with a sparse inducing normal mixture prior. This\nframework not only reduces ultra-high dimensionality to a manageable level,\nresulting in efficient estimation, but also optimizes prediction accuracy in\nthe search for informative sub-tensors. Posterior computation proceeds via an\nefficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Simulation shows that TPRM\noutperforms several other competing methods. We apply TPRM to predict disease\nstatus (Alzheimer versus control) by using structural magnetic resonance\nimaging data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\n(ADNI) study.",

A survival analysis(Cox regression)\nand infinite Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) are introduced to identify the\ninformative brain regions, which can be further used to make a prediction of\nconversion (in two years) from MCI to AD using only the baseline PET scan.\nFurther, the predictive accuracy can be enhanced when non-imaging variables are\nused together with identified informative brain voxels.

Using structural MRI data, we\nidentify areas in fronto-temporo-parietal cortex with reduced gray matter\ndensity in corticobasal syndrome relative to age matched controls. A support\nvector machine procedure demonstrates that gray matter density poorly\ndiscriminates between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease\npathology subgroups with low sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, a\nstatistic of local network efficiency demonstrates excellent discriminatory\npower, with high sensitivity and specificity. Our results indicate that the\nunderlying pathological sources of corticobasal syndrome can be classified more\naccurately using graph theoretical statistics of white matter microstructure in\nassociation cortex than by regional gray matter density alone. These results\nhighlight the importance of a multimodal neuroimaging approach to diagnostic\nanalyses of corticobasal syndrome and suggest that distinct sources of\npathology mediate the circuitry of brain regions affected by corticobasal\nsyndrome.",

Our approach is to treat subgroups as related problem instances and\njointly estimate subgroup-specific regression coefficients. This is done in a\npenalized framework, combining an $\\ell_1$ term with an additional term that\npenalizes differences between subgroup-specific coefficients. This gives\nsolutions that are globally sparse but that allow information-sharing between\nthe subgroups. We present algorithms for estimation and empirical results on\nsimulated data and using Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and\ncancer datasets.

In this paper, we develop DEPID, a novel\ndependency-based method for computing PID, and its version DEPID-R that enables\nto exclude repeating ideas---a feature characteristic to AD speech. We conduct\nthe first comparison of automatically extracted PID and SID in the diagnostic\nclassification task on two different AD datasets covering both closed-topic and\nfree-recall domains. While SID performs better on the normative dataset, adding\nPID leads to a small but significant improvement (+1.7 F-score).

In this paper, we attempt solving these\nissues with transfer learning, where state-of-the-art architectures such as VGG\nand Inception are initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark\ndatasets consisting of natural images, and the fully-connected layer is\nre-trained with only a small number of MRI images. We employ image entropy to\nselect the most informative slices for training. Through experimentation on the\nOASIS MRI dataset, we show that with training size almost 10 times smaller than\nthe state-of-the-art, we reach comparable or even better performance than\ncurrent deep-learning based methods.",

        "summary": "Emerging evidence shows that cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD) are\nassociated with disruptions in brain functional connectivity. Thus, the\nidentification of alterations in AD functional networks has become a topic of\nincreasing interest. However, to what extent AD induces disruption of the\nbalance of local and global information processing in the human brain remains\nelusive. The main objective of this study is to explore the dynamic topological\nchanges of AD networks in terms of brain network segregation and integration.\nWe used electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from 20 participants (10 AD\npatients and 10 healthy controls) during resting state. Functional brain\nnetworks were reconstructed using EEG source connectivity computed in different\nfrequency bands. Graph theoretical analyses were performed assess differences\nbetween both groups. Results revealed that AD networks, compared to networks of\nage matched healthy controls, are characterized by lower global information\nprocessing (integration) and higher local information processing (segregation).\nResults showed also significant correlation between the alterations in the AD\npatients functional brain networks and their cognitive scores. These findings\nmay contribute to the development of EEG network-based test that could\nstrengthen results obtained from currently used neurophysiological tests in\nneurodegenerative diseases.",

        "summary": "Robust strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection are important, given\nthe high prevalence of AD. In this paper, we study the performance and\ngeneralizability of three approaches for AD detection from speech on the recent\nADReSSo challenge dataset: 1) using conventional acoustic features 2) using\nnovel pre-trained acoustic embeddings 3) combining acoustic features and\nembeddings. We find that while feature-based approaches have a higher\nprecision, classification approaches relying on pre-trained embeddings prove to\nhave a higher, and more balanced cross-validated performance across multiple\nmetrics of performance. Further, embedding-only approaches are more\ngeneralizable. Our best model outperforms the acoustic baseline in the\nchallenge by 2.8%.",

The physical nature of MRI acquisition and reconstruction,\nhowever, causes variations in image intensity, resolution, and signal-to-noise\nratio. Since ML models are sensitive to such variations, performance on\nout-of-distribution data, which is inherent to the setting of a deployed\nhealthcare ML application, typically drops below acceptable levels.

However, jointly accounting for heterogeneous measures\nposes important challenges related to the modeling of the variability and the\ninterpretability of the results. These issues are here addressed by proposing a\nnovel multi-channel stochastic generative model. We assume that a latent\nvariable generates the data observed through different channels (e.g., clinical\nscores, imaging, ...) and describe an efficient way to estimate jointly the\ndistribution of both latent variable and data generative process. Experiments\non synthetic data show that the multi-channel formulation allows superior data\nreconstruction as opposed to the single channel one. Moreover, the derived\nlower bound of the model evidence represents a promising model selection\ncriterion. Experiments on AD data show that the model parameters can be used\nfor unsupervised patient stratification and for the joint interpretation of the\nheterogeneous observations. Because of its general and flexible formulation, we\nbelieve that the proposed method can find important applications as a general\ndata fusion technique.",

By leveraging\ninformation from both supervising auxiliary variables and unlabeled data, we\nseek to uncover more scientifically interpretable group structures that may be\nhidden by completely unsupervised analyses. In this work, we propose and\ndevelop a new statistical pattern discovery method named Supervised Convex\nClustering (SCC) that borrows strength from both information sources and guides\ntowards finding more interpretable patterns via a joint convex fusion penalty.\nWe develop several extensions of SCC to integrate different types of\nsupervising auxiliary variables, to adjust for additional covariates, and to\nfind biclusters. We demonstrate the practical advantages of SCC through\nsimulations and a case study on Alzheimer's Disease genomics. Specifically, we\ndiscover new candidate genes as well as new subtypes of Alzheimer's Disease\nthat can potentially lead to better understanding of the underlying genetic\nmechanisms responsible for the observed heterogeneity of cognitive decline in\nolder adults.",

Finally, an SVM classifier with linear kernel is used for the\nindividual evaluation of the three systems.

        "summary": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are commonly used for disease progression\nmodeling when the true patient health state is not fully known. Since HMMs\ntypically have multiple local optima, incorporating additional patient\ncovariates can improve parameter estimation and predictive performance. To\nallow for this, we develop hidden Markov recurrent neural networks (HMRNNs), a\nspecial case of recurrent neural networks that combine neural networks'\nflexibility with HMMs' interpretability. The HMRNN can be reduced to a standard\nHMM, with an identical likelihood function and parameter interpretations, but\nit can also combine an HMM with other predictive neural networks that take\npatient information as input. The HMRNN estimates all parameters simultaneously\nvia gradient descent. Using a dataset of Alzheimer's disease patients, we\ndemonstrate how the HMRNN can combine an HMM with other predictive neural\nnetworks to improve disease forecasting and to offer a novel clinical\ninterpretation compared with a standard HMM trained via\nexpectation-maximization.",

An optimal subset\nof tasks is first selected with a \"Support Vector Machine\" (SVM) associated\nwith a grid search. Mixtures of Gaussian distributions defined in the space of\ntask durations are then used to reproduce and explain the results of the SVM.\nFinally, a surprisingly simple and efficient ad hoc classification algorithm is\ndeduced from the Gaussian mixtures. Results- The solution presented in this\npaper makes two or even four times fewer errors than the best results of the\nstate of the art concerning the classification HC/ES-AD from handwriting and\ndrawing tasks. Discussion- The best SVM learning model reaches a high accuracy\nfor this classification but its learning capacity is too large to ensure a low\noverfitting risk regarding the small size of the dataset. The proposed ad hoc\nclassification algorithm only requires to optimize three real-parameters. It\nshould therefore benefit from a good generalization ability.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a severe brain disorder, destroying memories and\nbrain functions. AD causes chronically, progressively, and irreversibly\ncognitive declination and brain damages. The reliable and effective evaluation\nof early dementia has become essential research with medical imaging\ntechnologies and computer-aided algorithms. This trend has moved to modern\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) technologies motivated by deeplearning success in\nimage classification and natural language processing. The purpose of this\nreview is to provide an overview of the latest research involving deep-learning\nalgorithms in evaluating the process of dementia, diagnosing the early stage of\nAD, and discussing an outlook for this research. This review introduces various\napplications of modern AI algorithms in AD diagnosis, including Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Automatic Image\nSegmentation, Autoencoder, Graph CNN (GCN), Ensemble Learning, and Transfer\nLearning. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methods and their\nperformance are discussed. The conclusion section summarizes the primary\ncontributions and medical imaging preprocessing techniques applied in the\nreviewed research. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future outlooks.",

Quantitative methods like MRI\nscan assessment are inaccurate at best,due to the elusive nature of visually\nobservable changes in the brain.

Linear FC measures have been applied to study the\ndifferences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals such as\nelectroencephalography (EEG) recordings into discrete frequency bands and\nanalysing them in isolation. We address this limitation by quantifying\ncross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach.\nCross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis, is used to measure the\nnonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the\nlinear FC within bands. Each frequency coupling is then used to construct an FC\nnetwork, which is in turn vectorised and used to train a classifier. We show\nthat fusing features from networks improves classification accuracy. Although\nboth within-frequency and cross-frequency networks can be used to predict AD\nwith high accuracy, our results show that bispectrum-based FC outperforms\ncross-spectrum suggesting an important role of cross-frequency FC.",

This work demonstrates\nfor the first time the potential of the spherical CNNs framework in the\ndiscriminative analysis of the human cortex and could be extended to other\nmodalities and other neurological diseases.",

In this\npaper, we utilize clinical, imaging, genetic, and biospecimen features to\ncluster AD and PD patients into the same feature space. By training a machine\nlearning classifier on the combined feature space, we predict the disease stage\nof patients two years after their baseline visits. We observed a considerable\nimprovement in the prediction accuracy of Parkinson's dementia patients due to\ncombined training on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients, thereby affirming\nthe claim that these two diseases can be jointly studied.",

        "summary": "This manuscript presents an approach to perform generalized linear regression\nwith multiple high dimensional covariance matrices as the outcome. Model\nparameters are proposed to be estimated by maximizing a pseudo-likelihood. When\nthe data are high dimensional, the normal likelihood function is ill-posed as\nthe sample covariance matrix is rank-deficient. Thus, a well-conditioned linear\nshrinkage estimator of the covariance matrix is introduced. With multiple\ncovariance matrices, the shrinkage coefficients are proposed to be common\nacross matrices. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the proposed covariance\nmatrix estimator is optimal achieving the uniformly minimum quadratic loss\nasymptotically among all linear combinations of the identity matrix and the\nsample covariance matrix. Under regularity conditions, the proposed estimator\nof the model parameters is consistent. The superior performance of the proposed\napproach over existing methods is illustrated through simulation studies.\nImplemented to a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study\nacquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the proposed\napproach identified a brain network within which functional connectivity is\nsignificantly associated with Apolipoprotein E $\\varepsilon$4, a strong genetic\nmarker for Alzheimer's disease.",

Traditional methods usually depict the\ndata structure using fixed and predefined similarity matrix for each modality\nseparately, without considering the potential relationship structure across\ndifferent modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modality feature\nselection method, which performs feature selection and local similarity\nlearning simultaniously. Specially, a similarity matrix is learned by jointly\nconsidering different imaging modalities. And at the same time, feature\nselection is conducted by imposing sparse l_{2, 1} norm constraint.

Based on the cortical\nthickness of the ADNI dataset, we showed that the LB-CNN didn't improve\nclassification accuracy compared to the spectral graph-CNN. The three\npolynomials had a similar computational cost and showed comparable\nclassification accuracy in the LB-CNN or spectral graph-CNN.

Second, we\npropose linear mixed-effects models to quantify the pathological interactions\nand propagation of ATN biomarkers at each brain region. Our analysis of the\ncurrent data shows that there exists a temporal latency in the build-up of\namyloid to the onset of tau pathology and neurodegeneration.

Early detection, where spatial navigation\nis a crucial key, is regarded as an important way to prevent the disease. The\nproposed system is compared with a recent existing and thoroughly studied\nsystem using a game called Sea Hero Quest (SHQ), by analyzing spatial\nnavigational patterns of players.

        "summary": "Due to the limited availability of medical data, deep learning approaches for\nmedical image analysis tend to generalise poorly to unseen data. Augmenting\ndata during training with random transformations has been shown to help and\nbecame a ubiquitous technique for training neural networks. Here, we propose a\nnovel adversarial counterfactual augmentation scheme that aims at finding the\nmost \\textit{effective} synthesised images to improve downstream tasks, given a\npre-trained generative model. Specifically, we construct an adversarial game\nwhere we update the input \\textit{conditional factor} of the generator and the\ndownstream \\textit{classifier} with gradient backpropagation alternatively and\niteratively. This can be viewed as finding the `\\textit{weakness}' of the\nclassifier and purposely forcing it to \\textit{overcome} its weakness via the\ngenerative model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we\nvalidate the method with the classification of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as a\ndownstream task. The pre-trained generative model synthesises brain images\nusing age as conditional factor. Extensive experiments and ablation studies\nhave been performed to show that the proposed approach improves classification\nperformance and has potential to alleviate spurious correlations and\ncatastrophic forgetting.

Since AD significantly affects the acoustics of spontaneous speech,\nspeech processing and machine learning (ML) provide promising techniques for\nreliably detecting AD. However, speech audio may be affected by different types\nof background noise and it is important to understand how the noise influences\nthe accuracy of ML models detecting AD from speech. In this paper, we study the\neffect of fifteen types of environmental noise from five different categories\non the performance of four ML models trained with three types of acoustic\nrepresentations. We perform a thorough analysis showing how ML models and\nacoustic features are affected by different types of acoustic noise. We show\nthat acoustic noise is not necessarily harmful - certain types of noise are\nbeneficial for AD detection models and help increasing accuracy by up to 4.8\\%.\nWe provide recommendations on how to utilize acoustic noise in order to achieve\nthe best performance results with the ML models deployed in real world.",

These characteristics make AD biomarker identification from\nstructural brain imaging (e.g., structural MRI) scans quite challenging.\nFurthermore, there is a high possibility of getting entangled with normal\naging. We propose a novel deep-learning approach through eXplainable AD\nLikelihood Map Estimation (XADLiME) for AD progression modeling over 3D sMRIs\nusing clinically-guided prototype learning. Specifically, we establish a set of\ntopologically-aware prototypes onto the clusters of latent clinical features,\nuncovering an AD spectrum manifold. We then measure the similarities between\nlatent clinical features and well-established prototypes, estimating a \"pseudo\"\nlikelihood map. By considering this pseudo map as an enriched reference, we\nemploy an estimating network to estimate the AD likelihood map over a 3D sMRI\nscan. Additionally, we promote the explainability of such a likelihood map by\nrevealing a comprehensible overview from two perspectives: clinical and\nmorphological. During the inference, this estimated likelihood map served as a\nsubstitute over unseen sMRI scans for effectively conducting the downstream\ntask while providing thorough explainable states.",

Categorizing time in this way can be\nproblematic when assessments occur off-schedule, as including off-schedule\nvisits can induce bias, and excluding them ignores valuable information and\nviolates the intention to treat principle. This problem has been exacerbated by\nclinical trial visits which have been delayed due to the COVID19 pandemic. As\nan alternative to MMRM, we propose a constrained longitudinal data analysis\nwith natural cubic splines that treats time as continuous and uses test version\neffects to model the mean over time.

Analyzing the\nstructural brain networks of patients is vital for the recognition of MCI.\nHowever, the current studies on structural brain networks are totally dependent\non specific toolboxes, which is time-consuming and subjective.

In\nthis work, an adversarial learning-based structural brain-network generative\nmodel(SBGM) is proposed to directly learn the structural connections from brain\ndiffusion tensor images. By analyzing the differences in structural brain\nnetworks across subjects, we found that the structural brain networks of\nsubjects showed a consistent trend from elderly normal controls(NC) to early\nmild cognitive impairment(EMCI) to late mild cognitive impairment(LMCI):\nstructural connectivity progressed in a progressively weaker direction as the\ncondition worsened.

Nevertheless, such approaches fail to tackle\nseveral key issues: 1) AD is a complex neurocognitive disorder which means it\nis inappropriate to conduct AD detection using utterance information alone\nwhile ignoring dialogue information; 2) Utterances of AD patients contain many\ndisfluencies that affect speech recognition yet are helpful to diagnosis; 3) AD\npatients tend to speak less, causing dialogue breakdown as the disease\nprogresses. This fact leads to a small number of utterances, which may cause\ndetection bias. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel AD detection\narchitecture consisting of two major modules: an ensemble AD detector and a\nproactive listener. This architecture can be embedded in the dialogue system of\nconversational robots for healthcare.",

        "summary": "Developing successful artificial intelligence systems in practice depends on\nboth robust deep learning models and large, high-quality data. However,\nacquiring and labeling data can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming\nin many real-world applications, such as clinical disease models.\nSelf-supervised learning has demonstrated great potential in increasing model\naccuracy and robustness in small data regimes. In addition, many clinical\nimaging and disease modeling applications rely heavily on regression of\ncontinuous quantities. However, the applicability of self-supervised learning\nfor these medical-imaging regression tasks has not been extensively studied. In\nthis study, we develop a cross-domain self-supervised learning approach for\ndisease prognostic modeling as a regression problem using medical images as\ninput. We demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining can improve the\nprediction of Alzheimer's Disease progression from brain MRI. We also show that\npretraining on extended (but not labeled) brain MRI data outperforms\npretraining on natural images. We further observe that the highest performance\nis achieved when both natural images and extended brain-MRI data are used for\npretraining.",

Visual\nattention, as typical eye-tracking behavior, is of great clinical value to\ndetect cognitive abnormalities in AD patients. To better analyze the\ndifferences in visual attention between AD patients and normals, we first\nconduct a 3D comprehensive visual task on a non-invasive eye-tracking system to\ncollect visual attention heatmaps. We then propose a multi-layered comparison\nconvolution neural network (MC-CNN) to distinguish the visual attention\ndifferences between AD patients and normals.

It is interpretable by design and, thus, avoids the\nneed for post-hoc explanations that try to approximate the decision of a\nnetwork. Our results demonstrate that PANIC achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in AD classification, while directly providing local and global\nexplanations. Finally, we show that PANIC extracts biologically meaningful\nsignatures of AD, and satisfies a set of desirable desiderata for trustworthy\nmachine learning. Our implementation is available at\nhttps://github.com/ai-med/PANIC .",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research has shifted to focus on biomarker\ntrajectories and their potential use in understanding the underlying AD-related\npathological process. A conceptual framework was proposed in modern AD research\nthat hypothesized biomarker cascades as a result of underlying AD pathology. In\nthis paper, we leveraged this idea to jointly model AD biomarker trajectories\nas a function of the latent AD disease progression with individual and\ncovariate effects in the latent disease progression model and the biomarker\ncascade. We tailored our methods to address a number of real-data challenges\nthat are often present in AD studies. Simulation studies were performed to\ninvestigate the proposed approach under various realistic but less-than-ideal\nsituations. Finally, we illustrated the methods using real data from the\nBIOCARD and the ADNI studies. The analyses investigated cascading patterns of\nAD biomarkers in these datasets and presented prediction results for\nindividual-level profiles over time. These findings highlight the potential of\nthe conceptual biomarker cascade framework to be leveraged for diagnosis and\nmonitoring.",

Starting from medical images we construct a\nreduced-order model based on a graph brain connectome. The reaction coefficient\nof the proteins is modelled as a stochastic random field, taking into account\nall the many different underlying physical processes, which can hardly be\nmeasured. Its probability distribution is inferred by means of the Monte Carlo\nMarkov Chain method applied to clinical data. The resulting model is\npatient-specific and can be employed for predicting the disease's future\ndevelopment.

To\nestimate the warping function, it is proposed to minimize the average Hellinger\ndistance, which is equivalent to minimizing the average Fisher-Rao distance\nbetween densities. An optimization algorithm is introduced by estimating the\nsmooth monotone transformation of the warping function. Asymptotic properties\nof the proposed estimator are discussed. Simulation studies demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of the proposed approach over competing approaches in\npredicting outcome density functions.

        "summary": "Existing research has shown the potential of classifying Alzheimers Disease\n(AD) from eye-tracking (ET) data with classifiers that rely on task-specific\nengineered features. In this paper, we investigate whether we can improve on\nexisting results by using a Deep-Learning classifier trained end-to-end on raw\nET data. This classifier (VTNet) uses a GRU and a CNN in parallel to leverage\nboth visual (V) and temporal (T) representations of ET data and was previously\nused to detect user confusion while processing visual displays. A main\nchallenge in applying VTNet to our target AD classification task is that the\navailable ET data sequences are much longer than those used in the previous\nconfusion detection task, pushing the limits of what is manageable by\nLSTM-based models. We discuss how we address this challenge and show that VTNet\noutperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in AD classification, providing\nencouraging evidence on the generality of this model to make predictions from\nET data.",

However, it is a big\nchallenge to effectively fuse the correlated and complementary information from\nmultimodal neuroimages. In this paper, a novel model termed cross-modal\ntransformer generative adversarial network (CT-GAN) is proposed to effectively\nfuse the functional and structural information contained in functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The CT-GAN can\nlearn topological features and generate multimodal connectivity from multimodal\nimaging data in an efficient end-to-end manner. Moreover, the swapping\nbi-attention mechanism is designed to gradually align common features and\neffectively enhance the complementary features between modalities. By analyzing\nthe generated connectivity features, the proposed model can identify AD-related\nbrain connections. Evaluations on the public ADNI dataset show that the\nproposed CT-GAN can dramatically improve prediction performance and detect\nAD-related brain regions effectively. The proposed model also provides new\ninsights for detecting AD-related abnormal neural circuits.",

For instance, in structural Magnetic\nResonance Imaging for Alzheimer's Disease, the focus extends beyond examining\natrophic brain regions to include comparisons of anatomically adjacent regions.\nThese constraints can be modeled as linear transformations of parameters, where\nthe sign patterns play a crucial role in estimating directional effects. This\nclass of problems, encompassing total variations, wavelet transforms, fused\nLASSO, trend filtering, and more, presents an open challenge in effectively\ncontrolling the directional false discovery rate. In this paper, we propose an\nextended Split Knockoff method specifically designed to address the control of\ndirectional false discovery rate under linear transformations. Our proposed\napproach relaxes the stringent linear manifold constraint to its neighborhood,\nemploying a variable splitting technique commonly used in optimization. This\nmethodology yields an orthogonal design that benefits both power and\ndirectional false discovery rate control. By incorporating a sample splitting\nscheme, we achieve effective control of the directional false discovery rate,\nwith a notable reduction to zero as the relaxed neighborhood expands.

New\nevents generate synaptic and branching candidates competing for long-term\nenhancement. Competition resolution crucially depends on the formation of\nmembrane lipid rafts, which requires astrocyte-produced cholesterol. Sporadic\nAD is caused by impaired formation of plasma membrane lipid rafts, which\nprevents the conversion of short- to long-term memory, and yields excessive tau\nphosphorylation, intracellular cholesterol accumulation, synaptic dysfunction,\nand neurodegeneration. Amyloid beta (Abeta) production is promoted by\ncholesterol during the switch to competition resolution, and cholesterol\naccumulation stimulates chronic Abeta production, secretion, and aggregation.\nThe theory addresses all of the major established facts known about the\ndisease, and is supported by strong evidence.",

Previous studies of hippocampal asymmetry\nare limited to global volume or shape measures, which don't localize shape\nasymmetry at the point level. In this paper, we propose to quantify localized\nshape asymmetry by optimizing point correspondences between left and right\nhippocampi within a subject, while simultaneously favoring a compact\nstatistical shape model of the entire sample. To account for related variables\nthat have impact on AD and healthy subject differences, we build linear models\nwith other confounding factors. Our results on the OASIS3 dataset demonstrate\nthat compared to using volumetric information, shape asymmetry reveals\nfine-grained, localized differences that indicate the hippocampal regions of\nmost significant shape asymmetry in AD patients.",

This method is based on six-second recordings of\nthe sustained vowel /a/ spoken by the subject. The main original contribution\nof this work is the use of carefully crafted features based on sound objects.\nThis approach allows one to first represent the sound spectrum in a more\naccurate way than the standard spectrum, and then build interpretable features\ncontaining relevant information about subjects' control over their voice.\n  Results: ROC AUC obtained in this work for distinguishing healthy subjects\nfrom those with MCI was 0.85, while accuracy was 0.76.

Here, we investigate the importance of spatial\ninformation relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the\nproportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically\ntest various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets.\nOur findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal\ninformation and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second\ndataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase\nof 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for\nEEG-based AD classification.

        "summary": "In many empirical settings, directly observing a treatment variable may be\ninfeasible although an error-prone surrogate measurement of the latter will\noften be available. Causal inference based solely on the surrogate measurement\nis particularly challenging without validation data. We propose a method that\nobviates the need for validation data by carefully incorporating the surrogate\nmeasurement with a proxy of the hidden treatment to obtain nonparametric\nidentification of several causal effects of interest, including the population\naverage treatment effect, the effect of treatment on the treated, quantile\ntreatment effects, and causal effects under marginal structural models. For\ninference, we provide general semiparametric theory for causal effects\nidentified using our approach and derive a large class of semiparametric\nefficient estimators with an appealing multiple robustness property. A\nsignificant obstacle to our approach is the estimation of nuisance functions\nwhich involve the hidden treatment therefore preventing the direct use of\nstandard machine learning algorithms, which we resolve by introducing a novel\nsemiparametric EM algorithm. We examine the finite-sample performance of our\nmethod using simulations and an application which aims to estimate the causal\neffect of Alzheimer's disease on hippocampal volume using data from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.",

In this pursuit, we utilize\nthe recently proposed synthetic nearest neighbors (SNN) estimator. At its core,\nSNN leverages information across patients to impute missing data associated\nwith each patient of interest. We focus on two types of missing data: (i)\nunrecorded outcomes from discontinuing the assigned treatments and (ii)\nunobserved outcomes associated with unassigned treatments. Data imputation in\nthe former powers and de-biases RCTs, while data imputation in the latter\nsimulates \"synthetic RCTs\" to predict the outcomes for each patient under every\ntreatment. The SNN estimator is interpretable, transparent, and causally\njustified under a broad class of missing data scenarios. Relative to several\nstandard methods, we empirically find that SNN performs well for the above two\napplications using Phase 3 clinical trial data on patients with Alzheimer's\nDisease. Our findings directly suggest that SNN can tackle a current pain point\nwithin the clinical trial workflow on patient dropouts and serve as a new tool\ntowards the development of precision medicine. Building on our insights, we\ndiscuss how SNN can further generalize to real-world applications.",

        "summary": "The rapid global aging trend has led to an increase in dementia cases,\nincluding Alzheimer's disease, underscoring the urgent need for early and\naccurate diagnostic methods. Traditional diagnostic techniques, such as\ncognitive tests, neuroimaging, and biomarker analysis, face significant\nlimitations in sensitivity, accessibility, and cost, particularly in the early\nstages. This study explores the potential of machine learning (ML) as a\ntransformative approach to enhance early dementia detection by leveraging ML\nmodels to analyze and integrate complex multimodal datasets, including\ncognitive assessments, neuroimaging, and genetic information. A comprehensive\nreview of existing literature was conducted to evaluate various ML models,\nincluding supervised learning, deep learning, and advanced techniques such as\nensemble learning and transformer models, assessing their accuracy,\ninterpretability, and potential for clinical integration. The findings indicate\nthat while ML models show significant promise in improving diagnostic precision\nand enabling earlier interventions, challenges remain in their\ngeneralizability, interpretability, and ethical deployment. This research\nconcludes by outlining future directions aimed at enhancing the clinical\nutility of ML models in dementia detection, emphasizing interdisciplinary\ncollaboration and ethically sound frameworks to improve early detection and\nintervention strategies for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.",

        "summary": "Molecular communication (MC) within the synaptic cleft is vital for\nneurotransmitter diffusion, a process critical to cognitive functions. In\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD), beta-amyloid oligomers (A$\\beta$os) disrupt this\ncommunication, leading to synaptic dysfunction. This paper investigates the\nmolecular interactions between glutamate, a key neurotransmitter, and\nA$\\beta$os within the synaptic cleft, aiming to elucidate the underlying\nmechanisms of this disruption. Through stochastic modeling, we simulate the\ndynamics of A$\\beta$os and their impact on glutamate diffusion. The findings,\nvalidated by comparing simulated results with existing experimental data,\ndemonstrate that A$\\beta$os serve as physical obstacles, hindering glutamate\nmovement and increasing collision frequency. This impairment of synaptic\ntransmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) by binding to receptors on the\npostsynaptic membrane is further validated against known molecular interaction\nbehaviors observed in similar neurodegenerative contexts. The study also\nexplores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate these disruptions. By\nenhancing our understanding of these molecular interactions, this research\ncontributes to the development of more effective treatments for AD, with the\nultimate goal of alleviating synaptic impairments associated with the disease.",

Recent\ndeep-learning advancements have facilitated automated AD detection through\nspontaneous speech. However, common transcript-based detection methods directly\nmodel text patterns in each utterance without a global view of the patient's\nlinguistic characteristics, resulting in limited discriminability and\ninterpretability. Despite the enhanced reasoning abilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs), there remains a gap in fully harnessing the reasoning ability to\nfacilitate AD detection and model interpretation. Therefore, we propose a\npatient-level transcript profiling framework leveraging LLM-based reasoning\naugmentation to systematically elicit linguistic deficit attributes.

However, previous pathological speech analysis models are\ncommonly designed for a specific disease while overlooking the connection\nbetween diseases, which may constrain performance and lower training\nefficiency. Instead of fine-tuning deep models for different tasks, prompt\ntuning is a much more efficient training paradigm. We thus propose a unified\npathological speech analysis system for as many as three diseases with the\nprompt tuning technique. This system uses prompt tuning to adjust only a small\npart of the parameters to detect different diseases from speeches of possible\npatients. Our system leverages a pre-trained spoken language model and\ndemonstrates strong performance across multiple disorders while only\nfine-tuning a fraction of the parameters.

SKAD is a derivative operation that offers an optimized approach\nto quantifying volumetric alterations through localized analysis of the\ngradients. By efficiently extracting gradient amplitude changes at critical\nspatial regions, this derivative operation captures regional volume variations\nEvaluation of SKAD over various medical datasets demonstrates that it is 6.3x\nfaster than Jacobian maps while still maintaining comparable accuracy. This\nmakes it an efficient and competitive approach in neuroimaging research and\nclinical practice.",

        "summary": "Dementia is a progressive cognitive syndrome with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as\nthe leading cause. Conversation-based AD detection offers a cost-effective\nalternative to clinical methods, as language dysfunction is an early biomarker\nof AD. However, most prior research has framed AD detection as a binary\nclassification problem, limiting the ability to identify Mild Cognitive\nImpairment (MCI)-a crucial stage for early intervention. Also, studies\nprimarily rely on single-language datasets, mainly in English, restricting\ncross-language generalizability. To address this gap, we make three key\ncontributions. First, we introduce a novel, multilingual dataset for AD\ndetection by unifying 16 publicly available dementia-related conversational\ndatasets. This corpus spans English, Spanish, Chinese, and Greek and\nincorporates both audio and text data derived from a variety of cognitive\nassessment tasks. Second, we perform finer-grained classification, including\nMCI, and evaluate various classifiers using sparse and dense text\nrepresentations. Third, we conduct experiments in monolingual and multilingual\nsettings, finding that some languages benefit from multilingual training while\nothers perform better independently. This study highlights the challenges in\nmultilingual AD detection and enables future research on both language-specific\napproaches and techniques aimed at improving model generalization and\nrobustness.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is complex, requiring the integration of\nimaging and clinical data for accurate assessment. While deep learning has\nshown promise in brain MRI analysis, it often functions as a black box,\nlimiting interpretability and lacking mechanisms to effectively integrate\ncritical clinical data such as biomarkers, medical history, and demographic\ninformation. To bridge this gap, we propose NeuroSymAD, a neuro-symbolic\nframework that synergizes neural networks with symbolic reasoning. A neural\nnetwork percepts brain MRI scans, while a large language model (LLM) distills\nmedical rules to guide a symbolic system in reasoning over biomarkers and\nmedical history. This structured integration enhances both diagnostic accuracy\nand explainability. Experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that NeuroSymAD\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 2.91% in accuracy and 3.43% in\nF1-score while providing transparent and interpretable diagnosis.",

        "summary": "Characterizing a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) via single\nimaging is difficult as its early symptoms are quite subtle. Therefore, many\nneuroimaging studies are curated with various imaging modalities, e.g., MRI and\nPET, however, it is often challenging to acquire all of them from all subjects\nand missing data become inevitable. In this regards, in this paper, we propose\na framework that generates unobserved imaging measures for specific subjects\nusing their existing measures, thereby reducing the need for additional\nexaminations. Our framework transfers modality-specific style while preserving\nAD-specific content. This is done by domain adversarial training that preserves\nmodality-agnostic but AD-specific information, while a generative adversarial\nnetwork adds an indistinguishable modality-specific style. Our proposed\nframework is evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\n(ADNI) study and compared with other imputation methods in terms of generated\ndata quality.

        "summary": "Multimodal neuroimaging provides complementary structural and functional\ninsights into both human brain organization and disease-related dynamics.\nRecent studies demonstrate enhanced diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD) through synergistic integration of neuroimaging data (e.g., sMRI,\nfMRI) with behavioral cognitive scores tabular data biomarkers. However, the\nintrinsic heterogeneity across modalities (e.g., 4D spatiotemporal fMRI\ndynamics vs. 3D anatomical sMRI structure) presents critical challenges for\ndiscriminative feature fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose M2M-AlignNet: a\ngeometry-aware multimodal co-attention network with latent alignment for early\nAD diagnosis using sMRI and fMRI. At the core of our approach is a\nmulti-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and\nreduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch\ncorrespondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with\ntheir sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally,\nwe propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover\nfusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing\nfeature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the\neffectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and\nsMRI as AD biomarkers.",

Their precise relations\nto the disease progression, however, is poorly understood. This lack of\nunderstanding limits our ability to diagnose the disease and intervene\neffectively at early stages. To provide better understanding of the relation\nbetween the disease and biomarker progressions, we propose a novel modeling\napproach to quantify the biomarkers' trajectories as functions of age. Building\non monotone regression splines, we introduce two additional shape constraints\nto incorporate structures informed by the current medical literature. First, we\nimpose the regression curves to satisfy a vanishing derivative condition,\nreflecting the observation that changes in biomarkers generally plateau at\nearly and late stages of the disease. Second, we enforce the regression curves\nto have a unique inflection point, which enhances interpretability of the\nestimated disease progression and facilitates assessment of temporal ordering\namong the biomarkers. We fit our shape-constrained regression model under\nBayesian framework to take advantage of its ability to account for the\nheterogeneity in disease progression among individuals.

        "title": "Inhibiting Alzheimer's Disease by Targeting Aggregation of Beta-Amyloid",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by dangerous amyloid plaques formed by\ndeposits of the protein Beta-Amyloid aggregates in the brain. The specific\namino acid sequence that is responsible for the aggregates of Beta-Amyloid is\nlys-leu-val-phe-phe (KLVFF). KLVFF aggregation inhibitors, which we design in\nthis paper, prevent KLVFF from binding with itself to form oligomers or fibrils\n(and eventually plaques) that cause neuronal death. Our binder-blocker peptides\nare designed such that, on one side, they bind strongly to KLVFF, and on the\nother side, they disrupt critical interactions, thus preventing aggregation.\nOur methods use optimization techniques and molecular simulations and identify\n10 candidate sequences for trial of the 3.2 million possible sequences. This\napproach for inhibitor identification can be generalized to other diseases\ncharacterized by protein aggregation, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, and\nprion diseases.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are progressive\nneurodegenerative conditions that impair memory, thought processes, and\nfunctioning. Family caregivers of individuals with AD/ADRD face significant\nmental health challenges due to long-term caregiving responsibilities.

Our study examines caregivers' mental wellbeing concerns,\nfocusing on the practices they adopt to manage the burden of caregiving and the\ntechnologies they use for support. Through semi-structured interviews with 25\nfamily caregivers of individuals with AD/ADRD, we identified the key causes and\neffects of mental health challenges, and developed a temporal mapping of how\ncaregivers' mental wellbeing evolves across three distinct stages of the\ncaregiving journey. Additionally, our participants shared insights into\nimprovements for existing mental health technologies, emphasizing the need for\naccessible, scalable, and personalized solutions that adapt to caregivers'\nchanging needs over time. These findings offer a foundation for designing\ndynamic, stage-sensitive interventions that holistically support caregivers'\nmental wellbeing, benefiting both caregivers and care recipients.",

Regression models in covariates including age, gender and disease status\nfor the extent of white matter connecting each pair of regions of brain are\nproposed. Subject inhomogeneity is also incorporated in the model through\nrandom effects with an unknown distribution. As there are large number of pairs\nof regions, we also adopt a dimension reduction technique through graphon\n(Lovasz and Szegedy (2006)) functions, which reduces functions of pairs of\nregions to functions of regions. The connecting graphon functions are\nconsidered unknown but assumed smoothness allows putting priors of low\ncomplexity on them. We pursue a nonparametric Bayesian approach by assigning a\nDirichlet process scale mixture of zero mean normal prior on the distributions\nof the random effects and finite random series of tensor products of B-splines\npriors on the underlying graphon functions. Markov chain Monte Carlo\ntechniques, for drawing samples for the posterior distributions are developed.\nThe proposed Bayesian method overwhelmingly outperforms similar ANCOVA models\nin the simulation setup. The proposed Bayesian approach is applied on a dataset\nof 100 subjects and 83 brain regions and key regions implicated in the changing\nconnectome are identified.",

        "summary": "Background:Cognitive assessments represent the most common clinical routine\nfor the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Given a large number of\ncognitive assessment tools and time-limited office visits, it is important to\ndetermine a proper set of cognitive tests for different subjects. Most current\nstudies create guidelines of cognitive test selection for a targeted\npopulation, but they are not customized for each individual subject. In this\nmanuscript, we develop a machine learning paradigm enabling personalized\ncognitive assessments prioritization. Method: We adapt a newly developed\nlearning-to-rank approach PLTR to implement our paradigm. This method learns\nthe latent scoring function that pushes the most effective cognitive\nassessments onto the top of the prioritization list. We also extend PLTR to\nbetter separate the most effective cognitive assessments and the less effective\nones. Results: Our empirical study on the ADNI data shows that the proposed\nparadigm outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on identifying and\nprioritizing individual-specific cognitive biomarkers. We conduct experiments\nin cross validation and level-out validation settings. In the two settings, our\nparadigm significantly outperforms the best baselines with improvement as much\nas 22.1% and 19.7%, respectively, on prioritizing cognitive features.\nConclusions: The proposed paradigm achieves superior performance on\nprioritizing cognitive biomarkers. The cognitive biomarkers prioritized on top\nhave great potentials to facilitate personalized diagnosis, disease subtyping,\nand ultimately precision medicine in AD.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a sequence of pathological\nchanges, which are commonly assessed in vivo using MRI and PET. Currently, the\nmost approaches to analyze statistical associations between brain regions rely\non Pearson correlation. However, these are prone to spurious correlations\narising from uninformative shared variance. Notably, there are no appropriate\nmultivariate statistical models available that can easily integrate dozens of\nvariables derived from such data, being able to use the additional information\nprovided from the combination of data sources. Gaussian graphical models (GGMs)\ncan estimate the conditional dependency from given data, which is expected to\nreflect the underlying causal relationships. We applied GGMs to assess\nmultimodal regional brain alterations in AD. We obtained data from N=972\nsubjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The mean amyloid\nload (AV45-PET), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), and gray matter volume (MRI)\nwere calculated. GGMs were estimated using a Bayesian framework for the\ncombined multimodal data to obtain conditional dependency networks. Conditional\ndependency matrices were much sparser (10% density) than Pearson correlation\nmatrices (50% density). Within modalities, conditional dependency networks\nyielded clusters connecting anatomically adjacent regions. For associations\nbetween different modalities, only few region-specific connections remained.\nGraph-theoretical network statistics were significantly altered between groups,\nwith a biphasic u-shape trajectory. GGMs removed shared variance among\nmultimodal measures of regional brain alterations in MCI and AD, and yielded\nsparser matrices compared to Pearson correlation networks. Therefore, GGMs may\nbe used as alternative to thresholding-approaches typically applied to\ncorrelation networks to obtain the most informative relations between\nvariables.",

DIVE is\nan image-based disease progression model with single-vertex resolution,\ndesigned to reconstruct long-term patterns of brain pathology from short-term\nlongitudinal data sets. DIVE clusters vertex-wise biomarker measurements on the\ncortical surface that have similar temporal dynamics across a patient\npopulation, and concurrently estimates an average trajectory of vertex\nmeasurements in each cluster. DIVE uniquely outputs a parcellation of the\ncortex into areas with common progression patterns, leading to a new signature\nfor individual diseases. DIVE further estimates the disease stage and\nprogression speed for every visit of every subject, potentially enhancing\nstratification for clinical trials or management. On simulated data, DIVE can\nrecover ground truth clusters and their underlying trajectory, provided the\naverage trajectories are sufficiently different between clusters. We\ndemonstrate DIVE on data from two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) and the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), UK, containing\npatients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) as well as typical Alzheimer's\ndisease (tAD). DIVE finds similar spatial patterns of atrophy for tAD subjects\nin the two independent datasets (ADNI and DRC), and further reveals distinct\npatterns of pathology in different diseases (tAD vs PCA) and for distinct types\nof biomarker data: cortical thickness from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs\namyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Finally, DIVE can be used\nto estimate a fine-grained spatial distribution of pathology in the brain using\nany kind of voxelwise or vertexwise measures including Jacobian compression\nmaps, fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from diffusion imaging or other PET\nmeasures.

        "summary": "Normative modelling is an emerging method for understanding the underlying\nheterogeneity within brain disorders like Alzheimer Disease (AD) by quantifying\nhow each patient deviates from the expected normative pattern that has been\nlearned from a healthy control distribution. Since AD is a multifactorial\ndisease with more than one biological pathways, multimodal magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) neuroimaging data can provide complementary information about the\ndisease heterogeneity. However, existing deep learning based normative models\non multimodal MRI data use unimodal autoencoders with a single encoder and\ndecoder that may fail to capture the relationship between brain measurements\nextracted from different MRI modalities. In this work, we propose multi-modal\nvariational autoencoder (mmVAE) based normative modelling framework that can\ncapture the joint distribution between different modalities to identify\nabnormal brain structural patterns in AD. Our multi-modal framework takes as\ninput Freesurfer processed brain region volumes from T1-weighted (cortical and\nsubcortical) and T2-weighed (hippocampal) scans of cognitively normal\nparticipants to learn the morphological characteristics of the healthy brain.\nThe estimated normative model is then applied on Alzheimer Disease (AD)\npatients to quantify the deviation in brain volumes and identify the abnormal\nbrain structural patterns due to the effect of the different AD stages. Our\nexperimental results show that modeling joint distribution between the multiple\nMRI modalities generates deviation maps that are more sensitive to disease\nstaging within AD, have a better correlation with patient cognition and result\nin higher number of brain regions with statistically significant deviations\ncompared to a unimodal baseline model with all modalities concatenated as a\nsingle input.",

        "summary": "Neuroimaging biomarkers that distinguish between typical brain aging and\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) are valuable for determining how much each contributes\nto cognitive decline. Machine learning models can derive multi-variate brain\nchange patterns related to the two processes, including the SPARE-AD (Spatial\nPatterns of Atrophy for Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease) and SPARE-BA (of\nBrain Aging) investigated herein. However, substantial overlap between brain\nregions affected in the two processes confounds measuring them independently.\nWe present a methodology toward disentangling the two. T1-weighted MRI images\nof 4,054 participants (48-95 years) with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI),\nor cognitively normal (CN) diagnoses from the iSTAGING (Imaging-based\ncoordinate SysTem for AGIng and NeurodeGenerative diseases) consortium were\nanalyzed. First, a subset of AD patients and CN adults were selected based\npurely on clinical diagnoses to train SPARE-BA1 (regression of age using CN\nindividuals) and SPARE-AD1 (classification of CN versus AD). Second, analogous\ngroups were selected based on clinical and molecular markers to train SPARE-BA2\nand SPARE-AD2: amyloid-positive (A+) AD continuum group (consisting of A+AD,\nA+MCI, and A+ and tau-positive CN individuals) and amyloid-negative (A-) CN\ngroup. Finally, the combined group of the AD continuum and A-/CN individuals\nwas used to train SPARE-BA3, with the intention to estimate brain age\nregardless of AD-related brain changes. Disentangled SPARE models derived brain\npatterns that were more specific to the two types of the brain changes.\nCorrelation between the SPARE-BA and SPARE-AD was significantly reduced.\nCorrelation of disentangled SPARE-AD was non-inferior to the molecular\nmeasurements and to the number of APOE4 alleles, but was less to AD-related\npsychometric test scores, suggesting contribution of advanced brain aging to\nthese scores.",

        "summary": "Accurately detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicting mini-mental\nstate examination (MMSE) score are important tasks in elderly health by\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Most of the previous methods on these two\ntasks are based on single-task learning and rarely consider the correlation\nbetween them. Since the MMSE score, which is an important basis for AD\ndiagnosis, can also reflect the progress of cognitive impairment, some studies\nhave begun to apply multi-task learning methods to these two tasks. However,\nhow to exploit feature correlation remains a challenging problem for these\nmethods. To comprehensively address this challenge, we propose a MRI-based\nmulti-task decoupled learning method for AD detection and MMSE score\nprediction. First, a multi-task learning network is proposed to implement AD\ndetection and MMSE score prediction, which exploits feature correlation by\nadding three multi-task interaction layers between the backbones of the two\ntasks. Each multi-task interaction layer contains two feature decoupling\nmodules and one feature interaction module. Furthermore, to enhance the\ngeneralization between tasks of the features selected by the feature decoupling\nmodule, we propose the feature consistency loss constrained feature decoupling\nmodule. Finally, in order to exploit the specific distribution information of\nMMSE score in different groups, a distribution loss is proposed to further\nenhance the model performance. We evaluate our proposed method on multi-site\ndatasets. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-task decoupled\nrepresentation learning method achieves good performance, outperforming\nsingle-task learning and other existing state-of-the-art methods.",

Transcriptomic analyses centred on metalloprotease genes unraveled\na 50% decrease in ADAM30 expression that inversely correlates with amyloid load\nin Alzheimer's disease brains. Accordingly, in vitro down-or up-regulation of\nADAM30 expression triggered an increase/decrease in A$\\beta$ peptides levels\nwhereas expression of a biologically inactive ADAM30 (ADAM30 mut) did not\naffect A$\\beta$ secretion. Proteomics/cell-based experiments showed that\nADAM30-dependent regulation of APP metabolism required both cathepsin D (CTSD)\nactivation and APP sorting to lysosomes. Accordingly, in Alzheimer-like\ntransgenic mice, neuronal ADAM30 over-expression lowered A$\\beta$42 secretion\nin neuron primary cultures, soluble A$\\beta$42 and amyloid plaque load levels\nin the brain and concomitantly enhanced CTSD activity and finally rescued long\nterm potentiation.",

In this work, we have proposed a novel computer-aided approach for early\ndiagnosis of AD by introducing an explainable 3D Residual Attention Deep Neural\nNetwork (3D ResAttNet) for end-to-end learning from sMRI scans. Different from\nthe existing approaches, the novelty of our approach is three-fold: 1) A\nResidual Self-Attention Deep Neural Network has been proposed to capture local,\nglobal and spatial information of MR images to improve diagnostic performance;\n2) An explanation method using Gradient-based Localization Class Activation\nmapping (Grad-CAM) has been introduced to improve the explainable of the\nproposed method; 3) This work has provided a full end-to-end learning solution\nfor automated disease diagnosis. Our proposed 3D ResAttNet method has been\nevaluated on a large cohort of subjects from real datasets for two changeling\nclassification tasks (i.e., Alzheimer's disease (AD) vs. Normal cohort (NC) and\nprogressive MCI (pMCI) vs. stable MCI (sMCI)). The experimental results show\nthat the proposed approach has a competitive advantage over the\nstate-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy performance and generalizability.\nThe explainable mechanism in our approach is able to identify and highlight the\ncontribution of the important brain parts (e.g., hippocampus, lateral ventricle\nand most parts of the cortex) for transparent decisions.",

We confirm the validity of our model by observing its performance in a\n25-trial Monte Carlo cross-validation.

        "summary": "Volume change measures derived from longitudinal MRI (e.g. hippocampal\natrophy) are a well-studied biomarker of disease progression in Alzheimer's\nDisease (AD) and are used in clinical trials to track the therapeutic efficacy\nof disease-modifying treatments. However, longitudinal MRI change measures can\nbe confounded by non-biological factors, such as different degrees of head\nmotion and susceptibility artifact between pairs of MRI scans. We hypothesize\nthat deep learning methods applied directly to pairs of longitudinal MRI scans\ncan be trained to differentiate between biological changes and non-biological\nfactors better than conventional approaches based on deformable image\nregistration. To achieve this, we make a simplifying assumption that biological\nfactors are associated with time (i.e. the hippocampus shrinks overtime in the\naging population) whereas non-biological factors are independent of time. We\nthen formulate deep learning networks to infer the temporal order of\nsame-subject MRI scans input to the network in arbitrary order; as well as to\ninfer ratios between interscan intervals for two pairs of same-subject MRI\nscans. In the test dataset, these networks perform better in tasks of temporal\nordering (89.3%) and interscan interval inference (86.1%) than a\nstate-of-the-art deformation-based morphometry method ALOHA (76.6% and 76.1%\nrespectively) (Das et al., 2012). Furthermore, we derive a disease progression\nscore from the network that is able to detect a group difference between 58\npreclinical AD and 75 beta-amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals\nwithin one year, compared to two years for ALOHA. This suggests that deep\nlearning can be trained to differentiate MRI changes due to biological factors\n(tissue loss) from changes due to non-biological factors, leading to novel\nbiomarkers that are more sensitive to longitudinal changes at the earliest\nstages of AD.",

        "title": "Brain Chains as Topological Signatures for Alzheimer's Disease",
        "summary": "We propose a topological framework to study the evolution of Alzheimer's\ndisease, the most common neurodegenerative disease. The modeling of this\ndisease starts with the representation of the brain connectivity as a graph and\nthe seeding of a toxic protein in a specific region represented by a vertex.\nOver time, the accumulation of toxic proteins at vertices and their propagation\nalong edges are modeled by a dynamical system on this graph. These dynamics\nprovide an order on the edges of the graph according to the damage created by\nhigh concentrations of proteins. This sequence of edges defines a filtration of\nthe graph. We consider different filtrations given by different disease seeding\nlocations. To study this filtration we propose a new combinatorial and\ntopological method. A filtration defines a maximal chain in the partially\nordered set of spanning subgraphs ordered by inclusion. To identify similar\ngraphs, and define a topological signature, we quotient this poset by graph\nhomotopy equivalence, which gives maximal chains in a smaller poset. We provide\nan algorithm to compute this direct quotient without computing all subgraphs\nand then propose bounds on the total number of graphs up to homotopy\nequivalence. To compare the maximal chains generated by this method, we extend\nKendall's $d_K$ metric for permutations to more general graded posets and\nestablish bounds for this metric. We then demonstrate the utility of this\nframework on actual brain graphs by studying the dynamics of tau proteins on\nthe structural connectome. {We show that the proposed topological brain chain\nequivalence classes distinguish different simulated subtypes of Alzheimer's\ndisease.",

With a single\nmodel, we analyze the language patterns and conversational context of\nAlzheimer's patients and derive answers from two results: patient\nclassification and chatbot. If the patient's language characteristics are\nidentified by chatbots in daily life, doctors can plan more precise diagnosis\nand treatment for early diagnosis. The proposed model is used to develop\nchatbots that replace questionnaires that required experts. There are two\nnatural language processing tasks performed by the model. The first is a\n'natural language classification' that indicates with probability whether the\npatient has an illness, and the second is to generate the next 'answer' of the\nchatbot to the patient's answer. In the first half, a context vector, which is\na characteristic of patient utterance, is extracted through a self-attention\nneural network. This context vector and chatbot (expert, moderator) questions\nare entered together into the encoder to obtain a matrix containing the\ncharacteristics of the interaction between the questioner and the patient. The\nvectorized matrix becomes a probability value for classification of patients.\nEnter the matrix into the decoder with the next answer from the chatbot (the\nmoderator) to generate the next utterance.

        "summary": "Longitudinal assessment of brain atrophy, particularly in the hippocampus, is\na well-studied biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD). In clinical trials, estimation of brain progressive rates can be\napplied to track therapeutic efficacy of disease modifying treatments. However,\nmost state-of-the-art measurements calculate changes directly by segmentation\nand/or deformable registration of MRI images, and may misreport head motion or\nMRI artifacts as neurodegeneration, impacting their accuracy. In our previous\nstudy, we developed a deep learning method DeepAtrophy that uses a\nconvolutional neural network to quantify differences between longitudinal MRI\nscan pairs that are associated with time. DeepAtrophy has high accuracy in\ninferring temporal information from longitudinal MRI scans, such as temporal\norder or relative inter-scan interval. DeepAtrophy also provides an overall\natrophy score that was shown to perform well as a potential biomarker of\ndisease progression and treatment efficacy. However, DeepAtrophy is not\ninterpretable, and it is unclear what changes in the MRI contribute to\nprogression measurements. In this paper, we propose Regional Deep Atrophy\n(RDA), which combines the temporal inference approach from DeepAtrophy with a\ndeformable registration neural network and attention mechanism that highlights\nregions in the MRI image where longitudinal changes are contributing to\ntemporal inference. RDA has similar prediction accuracy as DeepAtrophy, but its\nadditional interpretability makes it more acceptable for use in clinical\nsettings, and may lead to more sensitive biomarkers for disease monitoring in\nclinical trials of early AD.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive disease preceded by Mild Cognitive\nImpairment (MCI). Early detection of AD is crucial for making treatment\ndecisions. However, most of the literature on computer-assisted detection of AD\nfocuses on classifying brain images into one of three major categories:\nhealthy, MCI, and AD; or categorizing MCI patients into (1) progressive: those\nwho progress from MCI to AD at a future examination time, and (2) stable: those\nwho stay as MCI and never progress to AD. This misses the opportunity to\naccurately identify the trajectory of progressive MCI patients. In this paper,\nwe revisit the brain image classification task for AD identification and\nre-frame it as an ordinal classification task to predict how close a patient is\nto the severe AD stage. To this end, we select progressive MCI patients from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and construct an\nordinal dataset with a prediction target that indicates the time to progression\nto AD. We train a Siamese network model to predict the time to onset of AD\nbased on MRI brain images. We also propose a Weighted variety of Siamese\nnetwork and compare its performance to a baseline model. Our evaluations show\nthat incorporating a weighting factor to Siamese networks brings considerable\nperformance gain at predicting how close input brain MRI images are to\nprogressing to AD. Moreover, we complement our results with an interpretation\nof the learned embedding space of the Siamese networks using a model\nexplainability technique.",

        "summary": "Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) cannot be reversed or cured, timely\ndiagnosis can significantly reduce the burden of treatment and care. Current\nresearch on AD diagnosis models usually regards the diagnosis task as a typical\nclassification task with two primary assumptions: 1) All target categories are\nknown a priori; 2) The diagnostic strategy for each patient is consistent, that\nis, the number and type of model input data for each patient are the same.\nHowever, real-world clinical settings are open, with complexity and uncertainty\nin terms of both subjects and the resources of the medical institutions. This\nmeans that diagnostic models may encounter unseen disease categories and need\nto dynamically develop diagnostic strategies based on the subject's specific\ncircumstances and available medical resources. Thus, the AD diagnosis task is\ntangled and coupled with the diagnosis strategy formulation. To promote the\napplication of diagnostic systems in real-world clinical settings, we propose\nOpenClinicalAI for direct AD diagnosis in complex and uncertain clinical\nsettings. This is the first powerful end-to-end model to dynamically formulate\ndiagnostic strategies and provide diagnostic results based on the subject's\nconditions and available medical resources. OpenClinicalAI combines\nreciprocally coupled deep multiaction reinforcement learning (DMARL) for\ndiagnostic strategy formulation and multicenter meta-learning (MCML) for\nopen-set recognition. The experimental results show that OpenClinicalAI\nachieves better performance and fewer clinical examinations than the\nstate-of-the-art model. Our method provides an opportunity to embed the AD\ndiagnostic system into the current health care system to cooperate with\nclinicians to improve current health care.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant form of dementia, is a growing\nglobal challenge, emphasizing the urgent need for accurate and early diagnosis.\nCurrent clinical diagnoses rely on radiologist expert interpretation, which is\nprone to human error. Deep learning has thus far shown promise for early AD\ndiagnosis. However, existing methods often overlook focal structural atrophy\ncritical for enhanced understanding of the cerebral cortex neurodegeneration.\nThis paper proposes a deep learning framework that includes a novel\nstructure-focused neurodegeneration CNN architecture named SNeurodCNN and an\nimage brightness enhancement preprocessor using gamma correction. The\nSNeurodCNN architecture takes as input the focal structural atrophy features\nresulting from segmentation of brain structures captured through magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI). As a result, the architecture considers only necessary\nCNN components, which comprises of two downsampling convolutional blocks and\ntwo fully connected layers, for achieving the desired classification task, and\nutilises regularisation techniques to regularise learnable parameters.\nLeveraging mid-sagittal and para-sagittal brain image viewpoints from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, our framework\ndemonstrated exceptional performance. The para-sagittal viewpoint achieved\n97.8% accuracy, 97.0% specificity, and 98.5% sensitivity, while the\nmid-sagittal viewpoint offered deeper insights with 98.1% accuracy, 97.2%\nspecificity, and 99.0% sensitivity. Model analysis revealed the ability of\nSNeurodCNN to capture the structural dynamics of mild cognitive impairment\n(MCI) and AD in the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, cerebellum, temporal, and\nparietal lobe, suggesting its potential as a brain structural change\ndigi-biomarker for early AD diagnosis.

[$^{18}$F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission\ntomography ([$^{18}$F]-FDG PET) is used to monitor brain metabolism, aiding in\nthe diagnosis and assessment of AD over time. However, the feasibility of\nmulti-time point [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans for diagnosis is limited due to\nradiation exposure, cost, and patient burden. To address this, we have\ndeveloped a predictive image-to-image translation (I2I) model to forecast\nfuture [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans using baseline and year-one data. The proposed\nmodel employs a convolutional neural network architecture with long-short term\nmemory and was trained on [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET data from 161 individuals from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Our I2I network showed high\naccuracy in predicting year-two [18F]-FDG PET scans, with a mean absolute error\nof 0.031 and a structural similarity index of 0.961. Furthermore, the model\nsuccessfully predicted PET scans up to seven years post-baseline. Notably, the\npredicted [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET signal in an AD-susceptible meta-region was highly\naccurate for individuals with mild cognitive impairment across years. In\ncontrast, a linear model was sufficient for predicting brain metabolism in\ncognitively normal and dementia subjects.

In recent years, advancements in deep learning have shown\nremarkable potential in medical image analysis. Methods In this study, we\npresent \"ViTranZheimer,\" an AD diagnosis approach which leverages video vision\ntransformers to analyze 3D brain MRI data. By treating the 3D MRI volumes as\nvideos, we exploit the temporal dependencies between slices to capture\nintricate structural relationships. The video vision transformer's\nself-attention mechanisms enable the model to learn long-range dependencies and\nidentify subtle patterns that may indicate AD progression. Our proposed deep\nlearning framework seeks to enhance the accuracy and sensitivity of AD\ndiagnosis, empowering clinicians with a tool for early detection and\nintervention. We validate the performance of the video vision transformer using\nthe ADNI dataset and conduct comparative analyses with other relevant models.\nResults The proposed ViTranZheimer model is compared with two hybrid models,\nCNN-BiLSTM and ViT-BiLSTM. CNN-BiLSTM is the combination of a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long-short-term memory network\n(BiLSTM), while ViT-BiLSTM is the combination of a vision transformer (ViT)\nwith BiLSTM. The accuracy levels achieved in the ViTranZheimer, CNN-BiLSTM, and\nViT-BiLSTM models are 98.6%, 96.479%, and 97.465%, respectively. ViTranZheimer\ndemonstrated the highest accuracy at 98.6%, outperforming other models in this\nevaluation metric, indicating its superior performance in this specific\nevaluation metric.

        "title": "Explainable Graph-theoretical Machine Learning: with Application to\n  Alzheimer's Disease Prediction",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 50 million people worldwide and is projected\nto overwhelm 152 million by 2050. AD is characterized by cognitive decline due\npartly to disruptions in metabolic brain connectivity. Thus, early and accurate\ndetection of metabolic brain network impairments is crucial for AD management.\nChief to identifying such impairments is FDG-PET data. Despite advancements,\nmost graph-based studies using FDG-PET data rely on group-level analysis or\nthresholding. Yet, group-level analysis can veil individual differences and\nthresholding may overlook weaker but biologically critical brain connections.\nAdditionally, machine learning-based AD prediction largely focuses on\nunivariate outcomes, such as disease status. Here, we introduce explainable\ngraph-theoretical machine learning (XGML), a framework employing kernel density\nestimation and dynamic time warping to construct individual metabolic brain\ngraphs that capture the distance between pair-wise brain regions and identify\nsubgraphs most predictive of multivariate AD-related outcomes. Using FDG-PET\ndata from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, XGML builds\nmetabolic brain graphs and uncovers subgraphs predictive of eight AD-related\ncognitive scores in new subjects. XGML shows robust performance, particularly\nfor predicting scores measuring learning, memory, language, praxis, and\norientation, such as CDRSB ($r = 0.74$), ADAS11 ($r = 0.73$), and ADAS13 ($r =\n0.71$). Moreover, XGML unveils key edges jointly but differentially predictive\nof several AD-related outcomes; they may serve as potential network biomarkers\nfor assessing overall cognitive decline. Together, we show the promise of\ngraph-theoretical machine learning in biomarker discovery and disease\nprediction and its potential to improve our understanding of network neural\nmechanisms underlying AD.",

We examine\ninsertion of the regular A-beta peptide as well as mutants causing familial\nAlzheimer's disease, and find that all but one of the mutants change the\ninsertion behavior by causing the peptide to spend more simulation steps in\nonly one leaflet of the bilayer. We also find that A-beta 42, because of the\nextra hydrophobic residues relative to A-beta 40, is more likely to adopt this\nconformation than A-beta 40 in both wild-type and mutant forms. We argue\nqualitatively why these effects happen. Here, we present our results and\ndevelop the hypothesis that this partial insertion increases the probability of\nharmful channel formation. This hypothesis can partly explain why these\nmutations are neurotoxic simply due to peptide insertion behavior. We further\napply this model to various artificial A-beta mutants which have been examined\nexperimentally, and offer testable experimental predictions contrasting the\nroles of aggregation and insertion with regard to toxicity of A-beta mutants.\nThese can be used through further experiments to test our hypothesis.",

Multiple Correspondence Analysis was used in addition\nto usual statistical tests to identify homogenous FCs clusters concerning the\nappreciation or rejection of the considered technologies. Results - Two\nopposite clusters were clearly defined: FCs in favor of a substantial use of\ntechnology, and those rather or totally hostile. Furthermore the distributions\nof almost all the answers of appreciations were U shaped. Significant relations\nwere demonstrated between IT appreciation and FC's family or gender statuses\n(e.g., female FCs appreciated more than male FCs a tracking device for quick\nrecovering of wandering patients: p=0.0025, N=195). Conclusions - The study\nprovides further evidence of the contrasted perception of technology in\ndementia care at home, and suggests the development of public debates based on\nrigorous assessment of practices and a strict ethical aim to protect against\nmisuse.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia observed in the elderly\ndue to neurodegenerative disorder and dysfunction. This arises from alterations\nin synaptic functioning of neurons leading to cognitive impairment and memory\nloss. Recent experimental studies indicate that the amyloid beta (A beta)\nprotein, in its dimer and oligomer forms, affects the synaptic activity of\nneurons in the early stages of AD. However, the precise mechanism underlying A\nbeta induced synaptic depression is still not clearly understood. In this\npaper, we introduce an electrical model that provides a possible mechanism for\nthis. Our studies show that the competing effects of synaptic activity and the\nindirect interaction mediated by A beta, can disrupt the synchrony among\nneurons and severely affect the neuronal activity. This then leads to\nsub-threshold activity or synaptic silencing. This is in agreement with the\nreported disruption of cortical synaptic integration in the presence of A beta\nin transgenic mice. We suggest that direct electrophysiological measurements of\nA beta activity can establish its role in AD and the possible revival, proposed\nin our model. The mechanism proposed here is quite general and could account\nfor the role of the relevant protein in other neuronal disorders also.",

In this work, we establish the equivalence between two\npopular methods: kernel-machine regression (KMR), and kernel distance\ncovariance (KDC). KMR is a semiparametric regression frameworks that models the\ncovariate effects parametrically, while the genetic markers are considered\nnon-parametrically. KDC represents a class of methods that includes distance\ncovariance (DC) and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), which are\nnonparametric tests of independence. We show the equivalence between the score\ntest of KMR and the KDC statistic under certain conditions. This result leads\nto a novel generalization of the KDC test that incorporates the covariates. Our\ncontributions are three-fold: (1) establishing the equivalence between KMR and\nKDC; (2) showing that the principles of kernel machine regression can be\napplied to the interpretation of KDC; (3) the development of a broader class of\nKDC statistics, that the members are the quantities of different kernels. We\ndemonstrate the proposals using simulation studies.

        "summary": "Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild\ncognitive impairment (MCI) can be critical for early treatment and thus has\nattracted more and more attention nowadays. Since first introduced, machine\nlearning methods have been gaining increasing popularity for AD related\nresearch. Among the various identified biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) are widely used for the prediction of AD or MCI. However, before a\nmachine learning algorithm can be applied, image features need to be extracted\nto represent the MRI images. While good representations can be pivotal to the\nclassification performance, almost all the previous studies typically rely on\nhuman labelling to find the regions of interest (ROI) which may be correlated\nto AD, such as hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus, etc. This procedure requires\ndomain knowledge and is costly and tedious.\n  Instead of relying on extraction of ROI features, it is more promising to\nremove manual ROI labelling from the pipeline and directly work on the raw MRI\nimages. In other words, we can let the machine learning methods to figure out\nthese informative and discriminative image structures for AD classification. In\nthis work, we propose to learn deep convolutional image features using\nunsupervised and supervised learning. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful\ntool in the machine learning community and has been successfully applied to\nvarious tasks. We thus propose to exploit deep features of MRI images based on\na pre-trained large convolutional neural network (CNN) for AD and MCI\nclassification, which spares the effort of manual ROI annotation process.",

Structural measurements of brain atrophy in specific brain\nstructures such as hippocampus using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been\nreported to detect the development of dementia early in the course of the\ndisease. The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic\nsystem for AD using MRI, which is based on the automatic volumetry of segmented\nbrain images and generation of three-dimensional cortical thickness images\nusing the Eulerian partial differential equation (PDE) approach. We\ninvestigated the effect of the inhomogeneity of magnetic field strength and\nstatistical noise on the accuracy of our automatic volumetry and the PDE\napproach using the simulated MR images generated from BrainWeb. Our automatic\nvolumetry and PDE approach were robust against inhomogeneous magnetic field\nstrength. Although the accuracy of our automatic volumetry decreased with\nincreasing statistical noise, it was maintained when the statistical noise was\nless than 7-8%. The cortical thickness obtained by the PDE method tended to\ndecrease with increasing statistical noise. When we applied our method to\nclinical data, the cortical thinning due to brain atrophy was clearly\ndemonstrated in patients with brain atrophy. These results suggest that our\nsystem appears to be useful for the diagnosis of AD, because it allows us to\nautomatically evaluate the extent of brain atrophy and cortical thinning in a\nthree-dimensional manner.",

Thus, its\ndiagnostic utility regarding different stages of dementia is of great interest\nin neurological research, along with the question of whether its utility\ndepends on age or sex of the person being examined. However, SPECT or EEG\nmeasurements are intrinsically multivariate, and there has been a shortage of\nsufficiently general inferential techniques for the analysis of multivariate\ndata in factorial designs when neither multivariate normality nor equality of\ncovariance matrices across groups should be assumed. We adapt an asymptotic\nmodel based (parametric) bootstrap approach to this situation, demonstrate its\nability, and use it for a truly multivariate analysis of the EEG and SPECT\nmeasurements, taking into account demographic factors such as age and sex.\nThese multivariate results are supplemented by marginal effects bootstrap\ninference whose theoretical properties can be derived analogously to the\nmultivariate methods.

        "summary": "Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease\nrelated alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\beta$ levels.

        "summary": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have achieved great success in the\ngenetic study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Collaborative imaging genetics\nstudies across different research institutions show the effectiveness of\ndetecting genetic risk factors. However, the high dimensionality of GWAS data\nposes significant challenges in detecting risk SNPs for AD. Selecting relevant\nfeatures is crucial in predicting the response variable. In this study, we\npropose a novel Distributed Feature Selection Framework (DFSF) to conduct the\nlarge-scale imaging genetics studies across multiple institutions. To speed up\nthe learning process, we propose a family of distributed group Lasso screening\nrules to identify irrelevant features and remove them from the optimization.\nThen we select the relevant group features by performing the group Lasso\nfeature selection process in a sequence of parameters. Finally, we employ the\nstability selection to rank the top risk SNPs that might help detect the early\nstage of AD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed\nfeature selection model integrated with group Lasso feature selection as well\nas detecting the risk genetic factors across multiple research institutions\nsystem. Empirical studies are conducted on 809 subjects with 5.9 million SNPs\nwhich are distributed across several individual institutions, demonstrating the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of dementia. Its diagnosis requires\naccurate biomarkers that are sensitive to disease stages. In this respect, we\nregard probabilistic classification as a method of designing a probabilistic\nbiomarker for disease staging. Probabilistic biomarkers naturally support the\ninterpretation of decisions and evaluation of uncertainty associated with them.\nIn this paper, we obtain probabilistic biomarkers via Gaussian Processes.\nGaussian Processes enable probabilistic kernel machines that offer flexible\nmeans to accomplish Multiple Kernel Learning. Exploiting this flexibility, we\npropose a new variation of Automatic Relevance Determination and tackle the\nchallenges of high dimensionality through multiple kernels. Our research\nresults demonstrate that the Gaussian Process models are competitive with or\nbetter than the well-known Support Vector Machine in terms of classification\nperformance even in the cases of single kernel learning. Extending the basic\nscheme towards the Multiple Kernel Learning, we improve the efficacy of the\nGaussian Process models and their interpretability in terms of the known\nanatomical correlates of the disease. For instance, the disease pathology\nstarts in and around the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Through the use of\nGaussian Processes and Multiple Kernel Learning, we have automatically and\nefficiently determined those portions of neuroimaging data. In addition to\ntheir interpretability, our Gaussian Process models are competitive with recent\ndeep learning solutions under similar settings.",

The same scaling law has also been shown to hold\nacross brains of our own species, irrespective of age or sex. These results,\nhowever, only relate measures of complete cortical hemispheres. There are known\nsystematic variations in morphology between different brain regions, and\nregion-specific changes with age. It is therefore of interest to extend our\nanalyses to different cortical regions, and analyze the scaling law within an\nindividual brain.\n  Methods: To directly compare the morphology of sub-divisions of the cortical\nsurface in a size-independent manner, we base our method on a topological\ninvariant of closed surfaces. We reconstruct variables of a complete hemisphere\nfrom each lobe of the brain so that it has the same gyrification index, average\nthickness and average Gaussian curvature.\n  Results: We show that different lobes are morphologically diverse but obey\nthe same scaling law that was observed across human subjects and across\nmammalian species. This is also the case for subjects with Alzheimer's disease.\nThe age-dependent offset changes at similar rates for all lobes in healthy\nsubjects, but differs most dramatically in the temporal lobe in Alzheimer's\ndisease.\n  Significance: Our results further support the idea that while morphological\nparameters can vary locally across the cortical surface/across subjects of the\nsame species/across species, the processes that drive cortical gyrification are\nuniversal.",

        "summary": "Nowadays, a lot of scientific efforts are concentrated on the diagnosis of\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD) applying deep learning methods to neuroimaging data.\nEven for 2017, there were published more than a hundred papers dedicated to AD\ndiagnosis, whereas only a few works considered a problem of mild cognitive\nimpairments (MCI) conversion to the AD. However, the conversion prediction is\nan important problem since approximately 15% of patients with MCI converges to\nthe AD every year. In the current work, we are focusing on the conversion\nprediction using brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging and clinical data, such as\ndemographics, cognitive assessments, genetic, and biochemical markers. First of\nall, we applied state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms on the neuroimaging\ndata and compared these results with two machine learning algorithms that we\nfit using the clinical data. As a result, the models trained on the clinical\ndata outperform the deep learning algorithms applied to the MR images. To\nexplore the impact of neuroimaging further, we trained a deep feed-forward\nembedding using similarity learning with Histogram loss on all available MRIs\nand obtained 64-dimensional vector representation of neuroimaging data. The use\nof learned representation from the deep embedding allowed to increase the\nquality of prediction based on the neuroimaging. Finally, the current results\non this dataset show that the neuroimaging does affect conversion prediction,\nhowever, cannot noticeably increase the quality of the prediction. The best\nresults of predicting MCI-to-AD conversion are provided by XGBoost algorithm\ntrained on the clinical and embedding data. The resulting accuracy is 0.76 +-\n0.01 and the area under the ROC curve - 0.86 +- 0.01.",

The extracellular accumulation of\namyloid-$\\beta$ (A$\\beta$) in senile plaques is a principal event in the\npathogenesis and there is growing evidence that the dysregulation of lipid\npathways is implicated in the disease, however the link between these two is\nstill under study. In this work, we investigated human brain samples, from 11\nAD patients and a control cohort of age-matched subjects without AD, using\nlabel-free chemically-specific Raman micro-spectroscopy. The collected image\ndata were quantitatively analysed using an efficient quantitative\nunsupervised/partially supervised non-negative matrix factorization method, to\nretrieve the concentration maps and spectra of the samples' chemical\nconstituents. Significant changes in lipid composition as well as increased\nconcentrations of oxidative stress bio-markers were observed in AD tissues\ncompared to the control. In particular, the analysis revealed accumulations of\ncholesteryl esters with saturated long-chain fatty acids (FAs), A$\\beta$\nfibrils, arachidic acid, fibrin, collagen-like amyloidogenic component (CLAC),\n$\\beta$-carotene and magnetite, co-localising in A$\\beta$ plaques of AD human\nbrains and exhibiting concentrations highest at the fibrillar core and lowest\nat the rim.

        "summary": "As other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, the most frequent\ndementia in the elderly, is characterized by multiple progressive impairments\nin the brain structure and in clinical functions such as cognitive functioning\nand functional disability. Until recently, these components were mostly studied\nindependently since no joint model for multivariate longitudinal data and time\nto event was available in the statistical community. Yet, these components are\nfundamentally inter-related in the degradation process towards dementia and\nshould be analyzed together. We thus propose a joint model to simultaneously\ndescribe the dynamics of multiple correlated components. Each component,\ndefined as a latent process, is measured by one or several continuous markers\n(not necessarily Gaussian). Rather than considering the associated time to\ndiagnosis as in standard joint models, we assume diagnosis corresponds to the\npassing above a covariate-specific threshold (to be estimated) of a\npathological process which is modelled as a combination of the\ncomponent-specific latent processes. This definition captures the clinical\ncomplexity of diagnoses such as dementia diagnosis but also benefits from\nsimplifications for the computation of Maximum Likelihood Estimates. We show\nthat the model and estimation procedure can also handle competing clinical\nendpoints. The estimation procedure, implemented in a R package, is validated\nby simulations and the method is illustrated on a large French population-based\ncohort of cerebral aging in which we focused on the dynamics of three clinical\nmanifestations and the associated risk of dementia and death before dementia.",

        "title": "Using CNNs for AD classification based on spatial correlation of BOLD\n  signals during the observation",
        "summary": "Resting state functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) are commonly used\nfor classification of patients as having Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild\ncognitive impairment (MCI), or being cognitive normal (CN). Most methods use\ntime-series correlation of voxels signals during the observation period as a\nbasis for the classification. In this paper we show that Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) classification based on spatial correlation of time-averaged\nsignals yield a classification accuracy of up to 82% (sensitivity 86%,\nspecificity 80%)for a data set with 429 subjects (246 cognitive normal and 183\nAlzheimer patients). For the spatial correlation of time-averaged signal values\nwe use voxel subdomains around center points of the 90 regions AAL atlas. We\nform the subdomains as sets of voxels along a Hilbert curve of a bounding box\nin which the brain is embedded with the AAL regions center points serving as\nsubdomain seeds. The matrix resulting from the spatial correlation of the 90\narrays formed by the subdomain segments of the Hilbert curve yields a symmetric\n90x90 matrix that is used for the classification based on two different CNN\nnetworks, a 4-layer CNN network with 3x3 filters and with 4, 8, 16, and 32\noutput channels respectively, and a 2-layer CNN network with 3x3 filters and\nwith 4 and 8 output channels respectively. The results of the two networks are\nreported and compared.",

        "summary": "Emotions(like fear,anger,sadness,happiness etc.) are the fundamental features\nof human behavior and governs his/her mental health. The subtlety of emotional\nfluctuations can be examined through perturbation in conversations or speech.\nAnalysis of emotional state of a person from acoustical features of speech\nsignal leads to discovery of vital cues determining his or her mental health.\nHence, it's an important field of research in the area of Human Computer\nInteraction(HCI). In a recent work we have shown that how the contrast in\nHurst-Exponent calculated from the non-stationary and nonlinear aspects of\n\"angry\" and \"sad\" speech(spoken in English language) recordings in the\nToronto-Emotional-Speech-Set(TESS) can be used for early detection and\ndiagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. In this work we have extended the work and\nextracted Hurst-exponent for the speech-signals of similar emotions but spoken\nin German language. It has been observed that the Hurst-exponent efficiently\nsegregates the contrasting emotions of \"anger\" and \"sadness\" in the speech\nspoken in German language, in similar fashion it has been doing for English\nspeech. Hence it can be concluded that the Hurst-exponent can differentiate\namong speech spoken out of different emotions in language-independent manner.\nWe propose algorithm for a language-independent application for early\nnon-invasive detection of various severe neurocognitive-disorders like\nAlzheimer's Disease, MND(motor-neuron-disorder), ASD(autism-spectrum-disorder),\ndepression, suicidal-tendency etc. which is not possible with the state of the\nart medical science.",

        "summary": "Wearable data is a rich source of information that can provide deeper\nunderstanding of links between human behaviours and human health. Existing\nmodelling approaches use wearable data summarized at subject level via scalar\nsummaries using regression techniques, temporal (time-of-day) curves using\nfunctional data analysis (FDA), and distributions using distributional data\nanalysis (DDA). We propose to capture temporally local distributional\ninformation in wearable data using subject-specific time-by-distribution (TD)\ndata objects. Specifically, we propose scalar on time-by-distribution\nregression (SOTDR) to model associations between scalar response of interest\nsuch as health outcomes or disease status and TD predictors. We show that TD\ndata objects can be parsimoniously represented via a collection of time-varying\nL-moments that capture distributional changes over the time-of-day. The\nproposed method is applied to the accelerometry study of mild Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD). Mild AD is found to be significantly associated with reduced\nmaximal level of physical activity, particularly during morning hours. It is\nalso demonstrated that TD predictors attain much stronger associations with\nclinical cognitive scales of attention, verbal memory, and executive function\nwhen compared to predictors summarized via scalar total activity counts,\ntemporal functional curves, and quantile functions. Taken together, the present\nresults suggest that the SOTDR analysis provides novel insights into cognitive\nfunction and AD.",

        "summary": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a high-risk dementia condition which\nprogresses to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) at approximately 10% to 15% per\nyear. Characterization of group-level differences between two subtypes of MCI -\nstable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) is the key step to understand the\nmechanisms of MCI progression and enable possible delay of transition from MCI\nto AD. Functional connectivity (FC) is considered as a promising way to study\nMCI progression since which may show alterations even in preclinical stages and\nprovide substrates for AD progression. However, the representative FC patterns\nduring AD development for different clinical groups, especially for sMCI and\npMCI, have been understudied. In this work, we integrated autoencoder and\nmulti-class classification into a single deep model and successfully learned a\nset of clinical group related feature vectors. Specifically, we trained two\nnon-linear mappings which realized the mutual transformations between original\nFC space and the feature space. By mapping the learned clinical group related\nfeature vectors to the original FC space, representative FCs were constructed\nfor each group. Moreover, based on these feature vectors, our model achieves a\nhigh classification accuracy - 68% for multi-class classification (NC vs SMC vs\nsMCI vs pMCI vs AD).",

Some biomarkers derived from\nFDG-PET by computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) technologies have been proved that\nthey can accurately diagnosis normal control (NC), MCI, and AD. However, the\nstudies of identification of early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) with FDG-PET\nimages are still insufficient. Compared with studies based on fMRI and DTI\nimages, the researches of the inter-region representation features in FDG-PET\nimages are insufficient. Moreover, considering the variability in different\nindividuals, some hard samples which are very similar with both two classes\nlimit the classification performance. To tackle these problems, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel bilinear pooling and metric learning network (BMNet), which\ncan extract the inter-region representation features and distinguish hard\nsamples by constructing embedding space. To validate the proposed method, we\ncollect 998 FDG-PET images from ADNI. Following the common preprocessing steps,\n90 features are extracted from each FDG-PET image according to the automatic\nanatomical landmark (AAL) template and then sent into the proposed network.\nExtensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments are performed for multiple\ntwo-class classifications. Experiments show that most metrics are improved\nafter adding the bilinear pooling module and metric losses to the Baseline\nmodel respectively. Specifically, in the classification task between EMCI and\nLMCI, the specificity improves 6.38% after adding the triple metric loss, and\nthe negative predictive value (NPV) improves 3.45% after using the bilinear\npooling module.",

Recently, incorporating biological priors\ntogether with machine learning methods in GWA studies has attracted increasing\nattention. However, in real-world, nucleotide-level bio-priors have not been\nwell-studied to date. Alternatively, studies at gene-level, for example,\nprotein--protein interactions and pathways, are more rigorous and legitimate,\nand it is potentially beneficial to utilize such gene-level priors in GWAS. In\nthis paper, we proposed a novel two-level structured sparse model, called\nSparse Group Lasso with Group-level Graph structure (SGLGG), for GWAS. It can\nbe considered as a sparse group Lasso along with a group-level graph Lasso.\nEssentially, SGLGG penalizes the nucleotide-level sparsity as well as takes\nadvantages of gene-level priors (both gene groups and networks), to identifying\nphenotype-associated risk SNPs. We employ the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers algorithm to optimize the proposed model. Our experiments on the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative whole genome sequence data and\nneuroimage data demonstrate the effectiveness of SGLGG. As a regression model,\nit is competitive to the state-of-the-arts sparse models; as a variable\nselection method, SGLGG is promising for identifying Alzheimer's\ndisease-related risk SNPs.",

        "summary": "In the fields of neuroimaging and genetics, a key goal is testing the\nassociation of a single outcome with a very high-dimensional imaging or genetic\nvariable. Often, summary measures of the high-dimensional variable are created\nto sequentially test and localize the association with the outcome. In some\ncases, the results for summary measures are significant, but subsequent tests\nused to localize differences are underpowered and do not identify regions\nassociated with the outcome. Here, we propose a generalization of Rao's score\ntest based on projecting the score statistic onto a linear subspace of a\nhigh-dimensional parameter space. In addition, we provide methods to localize\nsignal in the high-dimensional space by projecting the scores to the subspace\nwhere the score test was performed. This allows for inference in the\nhigh-dimensional space to be performed on the same degrees of freedom as the\nscore test, effectively reducing the number of comparisons. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the test has competitive power relative to others commonly used. We\nillustrate the method by analyzing a subset of the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative dataset.

In this study, we reviewed\nneuroimaging-based technical methods developed for AD and mild-cognitive\nimpairment (MCI) classification and prediction tasks, selected by screening all\nMICCAI proceedings published between 2010 and 2016. We included papers that fit\ninto image-based or network-based categories. The majority of papers focused on\nclassifying MCI vs. AD brain states, which has enabled the discovery of\ndiscriminative or altered brain regions and connections. However, very few\nworks aimed to predict MCI progression based on early neuroimaging-based\nobservations. Despite the high importance of reliably identifying which early\nMCI patient will convert to AD, remain stable or reverse to normal over\nmonths/years, predictive models are still lagging behind.",

        "title": "Binary Classification of Alzheimer Disease using sMRI Imaging modality\n  and Deep Learning",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible devastative neurodegenerative\ndisorder associated with progressive impairment of memory and cognitive\nfunctions. Its early diagnosis is crucial for the development of possible\nfuture treatment option(s). Structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI) plays\nan important role to help in understanding the anatomical changes related to AD\nespecially in its early stages. Conventional methods require the expertise of\ndomain experts and extract hand-picked features such as gray matter\nsubstructures and train a classifier to distinguish AD subjects from healthy\nsubjects. Different from these methods, this paper proposes to construct\nmultiple deep 2D convolutional neural networks (2D-CNNs) to learn the various\nfeatures from local brain images which are combined to make the final\nclassification for AD diagnosis. The whole brain image was passed through two\ntransfer learning architectures; Inception version 3 and Xception; as well as\ncustom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with the help of separable\nconvolutional layers which can automatically learn the generic features from\nimaging data for classification. Our study is conducted using cross-sectional\nT1-weighted structural MRI brain images from Open Access Series of Imaging\nStudies (OASIS) database to maintain the size and contrast over different MRI\nscans. Experimental results show that the transfer learning approaches exceed\nthe performance of non-transfer learning based approaches demonstrating the\neffectiveness of these approaches for the binary AD classification task.",

        "summary": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the progressive atrophy leads to aberrant\nnetwork reconfigurations both at structural and functional levels. In such\nnetwork reorganization, the core and peripheral nodes appear to be crucial for\nthe prediction of clinical outcome due to their ability to influence\nlarge-scale functional integration. However, the role of the different types of\nbrain connectivity in such prediction still remains unclear. Using a multiplex\nnetwork approach we integrated information from DWI, fMRI and MEG brain\nconnectivity to extract an enriched description of the core-periphery structure\nin a group of AD patients and age-matched controls. Globally, the regional\ncoreness - i.e., the probability of a region to be in the multiplex core -\nsignificantly decreased in AD patients as a result of the randomization process\ninitiated by the neurodegeneration. Locally, the most impacted areas were in\nthe core of the network - including temporal, parietal and occipital areas -\nwhile we reported compensatory increments for the peripheral regions in the\nsensorimotor system. Furthermore, these network changes significantly predicted\nthe cognitive and memory impairment of patients. Taken together these results\nindicate that a more accurate description of neurodegenerative diseases can be\nobtained from the multimodal integration of neuroimaging-derived network data.",

As a result, models trained on linguistic features derived from\nsuch datasets may not be generalizable across tasks.

We demonstrate that normative data from multiple speech-based\ntasks helps improve AD detection by up to 9%. Visualization of decision\nboundaries reveals that models trained on a combination of structured picture\ndescriptions and unstructured conversational speech have the least out-of-task\nerror and show the most potential to generalize to multiple tasks. We analyze\nthe impact of age of the added samples and if they affect fairness in\nclassification.

Pathologically, AD is characterised by abnormal accumulation of\nbeta-amyloid (A$\\beta$) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite research\nadvances over the last few decades, there is currently still no cure for AD.\nAlthough, medications are available to control some behavioural symptoms and\nslow the disease's progression, most prescribed medications are based on\ncholinesterase inhibitors. Over the last decade, there has been increased\nattention towards novel drugs, targeting alternative neurotransmitter pathways,\nparticularly those targeting serotonergic (5-HT) system. In this review, we\nfocused on 5-HT receptor (5-HTR) mediated signalling and drugs that target\nthese receptors. These pathways regulate key proteins and kinases such as GSK-3\nthat are associated with abnormal levels of A$\\beta$ and tau in AD. We then\nreview computational studies related to 5-HT signalling pathways with the\npotential for providing deeper understanding of AD pathologies. In particular,\nwe suggest that multiscale and multilevel modelling approaches could\npotentially provide new insights into AD mechanisms, and towards discovering\nnovel 5-HTR based therapeutic targets.",

Early Ad signs are usually mistaken for normal\nage-related cognitive dysfunctions, thus patients usually start their treatment\nin advanced AD stages, when its benefits are severely limited. AD has no known\ncure, as such, hope lies on early diagnosis which usually depends on\nneuroimaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET). PET data is\nthen analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software, which uses\nmass univariate statistical analysis, inevitably incurring in errors derived\nfrom this multiple testing approach. Recently, Wang et al. (2020) formulated an\nalternative: applying functional data analysis (FDA), a relatively new branch\nof statistics, to calculate mean function and simultaneous confidence corridors\n(SCCs) for the difference between two groups' PET values. Here we test this\napproach with a practical application for AD diagnosis, estimating mean\nfunctions and SCCs for the difference between AD and control group's PET\nactivity and locating regions where this difference galls outside estimated\nSCCs, indicating differences in brain activity attributable to AD-derived\nneural loss. Our results are consistent with previous literature on AD\npathology and suggest that this FDA approach is more resilient to reductions in\nsample size and less dependent on ad hoc selection of an {\\alpha} level than\nits counterpart, suggesting that this novel technique is a promising venue for\nresearch in the field of medical imaging.",

Most of them focused on\nprediction or identification of statistical differences among different\nclinical groups or phases (e.g., longitudinal studies). The continuous nature\nof AD development and transition states between successive AD related stages\nhave been overlooked, especially in binary or multi-class classification.\nThough a few progression models of AD have been studied recently, they were\nmainly designed to determine and compare the order of specific biomarkers. How\nto effectively predict the individual patient's status within a wide spectrum\nof continuous AD progression has been largely overlooked. In this work, we\ndeveloped a novel learning-based embedding framework to encode the intrinsic\nrelations among AD related clinical stages by a set of meaningful embedding\nvectors in the latent space (Disease2Vec). We named this process as disease\nembedding. By disease em-bedding, the framework generates a disease embedding\ntree (DETree) which effectively represents different clinical stages as a tree\ntrajectory reflecting AD progression and thus can be used to predict clinical\nstatus by projecting individuals onto this continuous trajectory. Through this\nmodel, DETree can not only perform efficient and accurate prediction for\npatients at any stages of AD development (across five clinical groups instead\nof typical two groups), but also provide richer status information by examining\nthe projecting locations within a wide and continuous AD progression process.",

        "title": "Characterising Alzheimer's Disease with EEG-based Energy Landscape\n  Analysis",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative\ndiseases, with around 50 million patients worldwide. Accessible and\nnon-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore urgently\nrequired. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used\nwhen studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to predict AD\nwith high accuracy, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the\ndynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been\nproperly studied in the case of AD and EEG data. Energy landscape analysis is a\nmethod that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the\nfirst application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns\nenergy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations across brain\nregions. The energy is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence.\nBy studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and 20 healthy\nage-matched counterparts, significant differences were found. The dynamics of\nAD patients' brain networks were shown to be more constrained - with more local\nminima, less variation in basin size, and smaller basins. We show that energy\nlandscapes can predict AD with high accuracy, performing significantly better\nthan baseline models.",

        "summary": "With the advent of continuous health monitoring with wearable devices, users\nnow generate their unique streams of continuous data such as minute-level step\ncounts or heartbeats. Summarizing these streams via scalar summaries often\nignores the distributional nature of wearable data and almost unavoidably leads\nto the loss of critical information. We propose to capture the distributional\nnature of wearable data via user-specific quantile functions (QF) and use these\nQFs as predictors in scalar-on-quantile-function-regression (SOQFR). As an\nalternative approach, we also propose to represent QFs via user-specific\nL-moments, robust rank-based analogs of traditional moments, and use L-moments\nas predictors in SOQFR (SOQFR-L). These two approaches provide two mutually\nconsistent interpretations: in terms of quantile levels by SOQFR and in terms\nof L-moments by SOQFR-L. We also demonstrate how to deal with multi-modal\ndistributional data via Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) using\nL-moments. The proposed methods are illustrated in a study of association of\ndigital gait biomarkers with cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nOur analysis shows that the proposed methods demonstrate higher predictive\nperformance and attain much stronger associations with clinical cognitive\nscales compared to simple distributional summaries.",

        "summary": "Objective: This paper presents an Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection method\nbased on learning structural similarity between Magnetic Resonance Images\n(MRIs) and representing this similarity as a graph. Methods: We construct the\nsimilarity graph using embedded features of the input image (i.e., Non-Demented\n(ND), Very Mild Demented (VMD), Mild Demented (MD), and Moderated Demented\n(MDTD)). We experiment and compare different dimension-reduction and clustering\nalgorithms to construct the best similarity graph to capture the similarity\nbetween the same class images using the cosine distance as a similarity\nmeasure. We utilize the similarity graph to present (sample) the training data\nto a convolutional neural network (CNN). We use the similarity graph as a\nregularizer in the loss function of a CNN model to minimize the distance\nbetween the input images and their k-nearest neighbours in the similarity graph\nwhile minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss between the training image\npredictions and the actual image class labels.

Thus, specialists can begin preventive treatment as soon as possible.\nThey demand fast and precise assessment in the diagnosis of AD in the earliest\nand hardest to detect stages. The main objective of this work is to develop a\nsystem that automatically detects the presence of the disease in sagittal\nmagnetic resonance images (MRI), which are not generally used. Sagittal MRIs\nfrom ADNI and OASIS data sets were employed. Experiments were conducted using\nTransfer Learning (TL) techniques in order to achieve more accurate results.\nThere are two main conclusions to be drawn from this work: first, the damages\nrelated to AD and its stages can be distinguished in sagittal MRI and, second,\nthe results obtained using DL models with sagittal MRIs are similar to the\nstate-of-the-art, which uses the horizontal-plane MRI. Although sagittal-plane\nMRIs are not commonly used, this work proved that they were, at least, as\neffective as MRI from other planes at identifying AD in early stages. This\ncould pave the way for further research. Finally, one should bear in mind that\nin certain fields, obtaining the examples for a data set can be very expensive.\nThis study proved that DL models could be built in these fields, whereas TL is\nan essential tool for completing the task with fewer examples.",

        "summary": "One of the main reasons for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the disorder of some\nneural circuits. Existing methods for AD prediction have achieved great\nsuccess, however, detecting abnormal neural circuits from the perspective of\nbrain networks is still a big challenge. In this work, a novel decoupling\ngenerative adversarial network (DecGAN) is proposed to detect abnormal neural\ncircuits for AD. Concretely, a decoupling module is designed to decompose a\nbrain network into two parts: one part is composed of a few sparse graphs which\nrepresent the neural circuits largely determining the development of AD; the\nother part is a supplement graph, whose influence on AD can be ignored.\nFurthermore, the adversarial strategy is utilized to guide the decoupling\nmodule to extract the feature more related to AD. Meanwhile, by encoding the\ndetected neural circuits to hypergraph data, an analytic module associated with\nthe hyperedge neurons algorithm is designed to identify the neural circuits.\nMore importantly, a novel sparse capacity loss based on the spatial-spectral\nhypergraph similarity is developed to minimize the intrinsic topological\ndistribution of neural circuits, which can significantly improve the accuracy\nand robustness of the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed model can effectively detect the abnormal neural circuits at different\nstages of AD, which is helpful for pathological study and early treatment.",

        "summary": "Biomarker-assisted diagnosis and intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may\nbe the key to prevention breakthroughs. One of the hallmarks of AD is the\naccumulation of tau plaques in the human brain. However, current methods to\ndetect tau pathology are either invasive (lumbar puncture) or quite costly and\nnot widely available (Tau PET). In our previous work, structural MRI-based\nhippocampal multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) showed superior\nperformance as an effective neurodegenerative biomarker for preclinical AD and\nPatch Analysis-based Surface Correntropy-induced Sparse coding and max-pooling\n(PASCS-MP) has excellent ability to generate low-dimensional representations\nwith strong statistical power for brain amyloid prediction. In this work, we\napply this framework together with ridge regression models to predict Tau\ndeposition in Braak12 and Braak34 brain regions separately. We evaluate our\nframework on 925 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\n(ADNI). Each subject has one pair consisting of a PET image and MRI scan which\nwere collected at about the same times. Experimental results suggest that the\nrepresentations from our MMS and PASCS-MP have stronger predictive power and\ntheir predicted Braak12 and Braak34 are closer to the real values compared to\nthe measures derived from other approaches such as hippocampal surface area and\nvolume, and shape morphometry features based on spherical harmonics (SPHARM).",

Early\ndiagnosis of MCI is necessary to prevent recurrence of the disease and\ndeveloping of miAD. For this purpose, we investigated the components of the Rey\nAuditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) to explore the auditory-verbal learning\n(AVL) disabilities in these patients. The AVL of 20 patients with miAD and 30\npatients with MCI were compared with 30 cognitively normal controls (CN) using\nthe RAVLT. General cognitive performance assessment was carried out based on\nthe Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Finally, Pearson's correlation\ncoefficients were used to evaluate the correlation between the MMSE scores and\nimmediate and delayed recalls, verbal learning and forgetting, and memory\nrecognition. We found that both miAD and MCI subjects were significantly\nimpaired in all components of the RAVLT. Compared to the MCI subjects, miAD\npatients performed worse on all components of the test. The MCI subjects had\nsignificantly lower scores than the CN group. The AVL analysis showed that\nthere were significant differences between the CN and other groups, but the\ndifference between MCI and miAD subjects was not significant. However, there\nwas no difference among the groups in their verbal forgetting scores. It can be\nconcluded that both patients with miAD and MCI were impaired in AVL and our\nfindings confirm that the RAVLT can take a part in the prediction of probable\nmiAD and early evaluation of individuals with subjective memory complaints.",

Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia,\nwhich constitutes a general term for loss of memory. Due to the fact that\ndementia affects speech, existing research initiatives focus on detecting\ndementia from spontaneous speech. However, little work has been done regarding\nthe conversion of speech data to Log-Mel spectrograms and Mel-frequency\ncepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and the usage of pretrained models. Concurrently,\nlittle work has been done in terms of both the usage of transformer networks\nand the way the two modalities, i.e., speech and transcripts, are combined in a\nsingle neural network. To address these limitations, first we represent speech\nsignal as an image and employ several pretrained models, with Vision\nTransformer (ViT) achieving the highest evaluation results. Secondly, we\npropose multimodal models. More specifically, our introduced models include\nGated Multimodal Unit in order to control the influence of each modality\ntowards the final classification and crossmodal attention so as to capture in\nan effective way the relationships between the two modalities.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common dementia affecting\ncognitive domains such as memory and learning, perceptual-motion or executive\nfunction. High rate of deaths and high cost for detection, treatments and\npatient's care count amongst its consequences. Early detection of AD is\nconsidered of high importance for improving the quality of life of patients and\ntheir families. The aim of this thesis is to introduce novel non-invasive early\ndiagnosis methods in order to speed the diagnosis, reduce the associated costs\nand make them widely accessible. Novel AD's screening tests based on virtual\nenvironments using new immersive technologies combined with advanced Human\nComputer Interaction (HCI) systems are introduced. Four tests demonstrate the\nwide range of screening mechanisms based on cognitive domain impairments that\ncan be designed using virtual environments. The use of emotion recognition to\nanalyse AD symptoms has been also proposed. A novel multimodal dataset was\nspecifically created to remark the autobiographical memory deficits of AD\npatients. Data from this dataset is used to introduce novel descriptors for\nElectroencephalogram (EEG) and facial images data. EEG features are based on\nquaternions in order to keep the correlation information between sensors,\nwhereas, for facial expression recognition, a preprocessing method for motion\nmagnification and descriptors based on origami crease pattern algorithm are\nproposed to enhance facial micro-expressions. These features have been proved\non classifiers such as SVM and Adaboost for the classification of reactions to\nautobiographical stimuli such as long and short term memories.",

        "summary": "Recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient studies have focused on retinal\nanalysis, as the retina is the only part of the central nervous system which\ncan be imaged non-invasively by optical methods. However as this is a\nrelatively new approach, the occurrence and role of pathological features such\nas retinal layer thinning, extracellular amyloid beta (A$\\beta$) accumulation\nand vascular changes is still debated. Animal models of AD are therefore often\nused in attempts to understand the disease. In this work, both eyes of 24\nAPP/PS1 transgenic mice (age: 45-104 weeks) and 15 age-matched wildtype\nlittermates were imaged by a custom-built multi-contrast optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) system. The system provided a combination of standard\nreflectivity data, polarization-sensitive data and OCT angiograms. This\ntri-fold contrast provided qualitative and quantitative information on retinal\nlayer thickness and structure, presence of hyper-reflective foci, phase\nretardation abnormalities and retinal vasculature. While abnormal structural\nproperties and phase retardation signals were observed in the retinas, the\nobservations were very similar in transgenic and control mice. At the end of\nthe experiment, retinas and brains were harvested from a subset of the mice (14\ntransgenic, 7 age-matched control) in order to compare the in vivo results to\nhistological analysis, and to quantify the cortical A$\\beta$ plaque load.",

        "summary": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are becoming prominent models for\nsemi-automated diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using brain Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI). Although being highly accurate, deep CNN models lack\ntransparency and interpretability, precluding adequate clinical reasoning and\nnot complying with most current regulatory demands. One popular choice for\nexplaining deep image models is occluding regions of the image to isolate their\ninfluence on the prediction. However, existing methods for occluding patches of\nbrain scans generate images outside the distribution to which the model was\ntrained for, thus leading to unreliable explanations. In this paper, we propose\nan alternative explanation method that is specifically designed for the brain\nscan task. Our method, which we refer to as Swap Test, produces heatmaps that\ndepict the areas of the brain that are most indicative of AD, providing\ninterpretability for the model's decisions in a format understandable to\nclinicians. Experimental results using an axiomatic evaluation show that the\nproposed method is more suitable for explaining the diagnosis of AD using MRI\nwhile the opposite trend was observed when using a typical occlusion test.\nTherefore, we believe our method may address the inherent black-box nature of\ndeep neural networks that are capable of diagnosing AD.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that\nprogressively destroys memory and other cognitive domains of the brain. While\neffective therapeutic management of AD is still in development, it seems\nreasonable to expect their prospective outcomes to depend on the severity of\nbaseline pathology. For this reason, substantial research efforts have been\ninvested in the development of effective means of non-invasive diagnosis of AD\nat its earliest possible stages. In pursuit of the same objective, the present\npaper addresses the problem of the quantitative diagnosis of AD by means of\nDiffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI). In particular, the paper\nintroduces the notion of a pathology specific imaging contrast (PSIC), which,\nin addition to supplying a valuable diagnostic score, can serve as a means of\nvisual representation of the spatial extent of neurodegeneration. The values of\nPSIC are computed by a dedicated deep neural network (DNN), which has been\nspecially adapted to the processing of dMRI signals. Once available, such\nvalues can be used for several important purposes, including stratification of\nstudy subjects. In particular, experiments confirm the DNN-based classification\ncan outperform a wide range of alternative approaches in application to the\nbasic problem of stratification of cognitively normal (CN) and AD subjects.\nNotwithstanding its preliminary nature, this result suggests a strong rationale\nfor further extension and improvement of the explorative methodology described\nin this paper.",

In this paper, we focus on Alzheimer's\ndisease, where it is believed that the concentration changes in amyloid-beta\nand tau proteins play a central role in its onset and development. A multiscale\nmodel is proposed to analyze the propagation of these concentrations in the\nbrain connectome.

We have studied these propagations for\nthe primary and secondary and their mixed tauopathy. We model the damage of a\nbrain cell by the nonlocal contributions of these toxic loads present in the\nbrain cells. With the help of rigorous analysis, we check the stability\nbehaviour of the stationary points corresponding to the homogeneous system.\nAfter integrating the brain connectome data into the developed model, we see\nthat the spreading patterns of the toxic concentrations for the whole brain are\nthe same, but their concentrations are different in different regions. Also,\nthe time to propagate the damage in each region of the brain connectome is\ndifferent.",

This disease has a high prevalence primarily in the\nelderly accompanying memory loss and cognitive decline. AD detection is a\nchallenging task which many authors have developed numerous computerized\nautomatic diagnosis systems utilizing neuroimaging and other clinical data. MRI\nscans provide high-intensity visible features, making these scans the most\nwidely used brain imaging technique. In recent years deep learning has achieved\nleading success in medical image analysis. But a relatively little\ninvestigation has been done to apply deep learning techniques for the brain MRI\nclassification. This paper explores the construction of several deep learning\narchitectures evaluated on brain MRI images and segmented images. The idea\nbehind segmented images investigates the influence of image segmentation step\non deep learning classification. The image processing presented a pipeline\nconsisting of pre-processing to enhance the MRI scans and post-processing\nconsisting of a segmentation method for segmenting the brain tissues. The\nresults show that the processed images achieved a better accuracy in the binary\nclassification of AD vs. CN (Cognitively Normal) across four different\narchitectures.

Two\nprominent imaging paradigms, FreeSurfer (FS) and Advanced Normalization Tools\n(ANTs), feature multiple pipelines for extracting region-specific eCT\nmeasurements from raw MRI, but the sheer complexity of these pipelines makes it\ndifficult to choose between pipelines, compare results between pipelines, and\ncharacterize uncertainty in pipeline estimates. Worse yet, the EC is\nparticularly difficult to image, leading to variations in thickness estimates\nbetween pipelines that overwhelm physiologicl variations predictive of AD. We\nexamine the eCT outputs of seven different pipelines on MRIs from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Because of both theoretical and\npractical limitations, we have no gold standard by which to evaluate them.\nInstead, we use a Bayesian hierarchical model to combine the estimates. The\nresulting posterior distribution yields high-probability idealized eCT values\nthat account for inherent uncertainty through a flexible multivariate error\nmodel that supports different constant offsets, standard deviations,\ntailedness, and correlation structures between pipelines. Our hierarchical\nmodel directly relates idealized eCTs to clinical outcomes in a way that\npropagates eCT estimation uncertainty to clinical estimates while accounting\nfor longitudinal structure in the data. Surprisingly, even though it\nincorporates greater uncertainty in the predictor and regularization provided\nby the prior, the combined model reveals a stronger association between eCT and\ncognitive capacity than do nonhierarchical models based on data from single\npipelines alone.",

In recent\nyears, advances of deep learning in computer vision suggest a new research\ndirection for this problem. Current deep learning-based approaches in this\nfield, however, have a number of drawbacks, including the interpretability of\nmodel decisions, a lack of generalizability information and a lower performance\ncompared to traditional machine learning techniques. In this paper, we design a\ntwo-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the first stage, an\nensemble of 125 U-Nets is used to grade the input image, producing a 3D map\nthat reflects the disease severity at voxel-level. This map can help to\nlocalize abnormal brain areas caused by the disease. In the second stage, we\nmodel a graph per individual using the generated grading map and other\ninformation about the subject. We propose to use a graph convolutional neural\nnetwork classifier for the final classification. As a result, our framework\ndemonstrates comparative performance to the state-of-the-art methods in\ndifferent datasets for both diagnosis and prognosis.

We find that,\n(1) classification using 3D models gives an improvement of 1% in our setup, at\nthe cost of significantly longer training time and more computation power, (2)\nwith our dataset, pre-training yields minimal ($<0.5\\%$) improvement in model\nperformance, (3) most popular convolutional neural network models yield similar\nperformance when compared to each other. Lastly, we briefly compare the effects\nof two image preprocessing programs: FreeSurfer and Clinica, and find that the\nspatially normalized and segmented outputs from Clinica increased the accuracy\nof model prediction from 63% to 89% when compared to FreeSurfer images.",

        "summary": "Detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from neuroimaging data such as MRI\nthrough machine learning has been a subject of intense research in recent\nyears. Recent success of deep learning in computer vision has progressed such\nresearch further. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance\non a large number of training images, and requirement of careful optimization\nof the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these\nissues with transfer learning, where the state-of-the-art VGG architecture is\ninitialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting\nof natural images. The network is then fine-tuned with layer-wise tuning, where\nonly a pre-defined group of layers are trained on MRI images. To shrink the\ntraining data size, we employ image entropy to select the most informative\nslices. Through experimentation on the ADNI dataset, we show that with training\nsize of 10 to 20 times smaller than the other contemporary methods, we reach\nstate-of-the-art performance in AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. NC\nclassification problems, with a 4% and a 7% increase in accuracy over the\nstate-of-the-art for AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC, respectively. We also provide\ndetailed analysis of the effect of the intelligent training data selection\nmethod, changing the training size, and changing the number of layers to be\nfine-tuned. Finally, we provide Class Activation Maps (CAM) that demonstrate\nhow the proposed model focuses on discriminative image regions that are\nneuropathologically relevant, and can help the healthcare practitioner in\ninterpreting the model's decision making process.",

Towards this,\nunsupervised methods reconstruct a single medical image to detect outliers\neither in the learned feature space or from high reconstruction loss. However,\nwithout considering continuity between multiple adjacent slices, they cannot\ndirectly discriminate diseases composed of the accumulation of subtle\nanatomical anomalies, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Moreover, no study has\nshown how unsupervised anomaly detection is associated with disease stages.\nTherefore, we propose a two-step method using Generative Adversarial\nNetwork-based multiple adjacent brain MRI slice reconstruction to detect AD at\nvarious stages: (Reconstruction) Wasserstein loss with Gradient Penalty + L1\nloss---trained on 3 healthy slices to reconstruct the next 3\nones---reconstructs unseen healthy/AD cases; (Diagnosis) Average/Maximum loss\n(e.g., L2 loss) per scan discriminates them, comparing the reconstructed/ground\ntruth images. The results show that we can reliably detect AD at a very early\nstage with Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.780 while also detecting AD at a late\nstage much more accurately with AUC 0.917; since our method is fully\nunsupervised, it should also discover and alert any anomalies including rare\ndisease.",

In\nthis paper, we present a new MRI-based biomarker that enables us to predict\nconversion of MCI subjects to AD accurately. In order to better capture the AD\nsignature, we introduce two main contributions. First, we present a new\ngraph-based grading framework to combine inter-subject similarity features and\nintra-subject variability features. This framework involves patch-based grading\nof anatomical structures and graph-based modeling of structure alteration\nrelationships. Second, we propose an innovative multiscale brain analysis to\ncapture alterations caused by AD at different anatomical levels. Based on a\ncascade of classifiers, this multiscale approach enables the analysis of\nalterations of whole brain structures and hippocampus subfields at the same\ntime. During our experiments using the ADNI-1 dataset, the proposed multiscale\ngraph-based grading method obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 81% to\npredict conversion of MCI subjects to AD within three years. Moreover, when\ncombined with cognitive scores, the proposed method obtained 85% of AUC. These\nresults are competitive in comparison to state-of-the-art methods evaluated on\nthe same dataset.",

        "summary": "Currently, many studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are investigating the\nneurobiological factors behind the acquisition of beta-amyloid (A), pathologic\ntau (T), and neurodegeneration ([N]) biomarkers from neuroimages. However, a\nsystem-level mechanism of how these neuropathological burdens promote\nneurodegeneration and why AD exhibits characteristic progression is largely\nelusive. In this study, we combined the power of systems biology and network\nneuroscience to understand the dynamic interaction and diffusion process of\nAT[N] biomarkers from an unprecedented amount of longitudinal Amyloid PET scan,\nMRI imaging, and DTI data. Specifically, we developed a network-guided\nbiochemical model to jointly (1) model the interaction of AT[N] biomarkers at\neach brain region and (2) characterize their propagation pattern across the\nfiber pathways in the structural brain network, where the brain resilience is\nalso considered as a moderator of cognitive decline. Our biochemical model\noffers a greater mathematical insight to understand the physiopathological\nmechanism of AD progression by studying the system dynamics and stability.\nThus, an in-depth system-level analysis allows us to gain a new understanding\nof how AT[N] biomarkers spread throughout the brain, capture the early sign of\ncognitive decline, and predict the AD progression from the preclinical stage.",

Trained deep\nneural networks need to be generalizable to new data that was not seen before.\nIn practice, there is often insufficient training data available and\naugmentation is used to expand the dataset. Even though graph convolutional\nneural network (graph-CNN) has been widely used in deep learning, there is a\nlack of augmentation methods to generate data on graphs or surfaces. This study\nproposes two unbiased augmentation methods, Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction Data\nAugmentation (LB-eigDA) and Chebyshev polynomial Data Augmentation (C-pDA), to\ngenerate new data on surfaces, whose mean is the same as that of real data.\nLB-eigDA augments data via the resampling of the LB coefficients. In parallel\nwith LB-eigDA, we introduce a fast augmentation approach, C-pDA, that employs a\npolynomial approximation of LB spectral filters on surfaces. We design LB\nspectral bandpass filters by Chebyshev polynomial approximation and resample\nsignals filtered via these filters to generate new data on surfaces. We first\nvalidate LB-eigDA and C-pDA via simulated data and demonstrate their use for\nimproving classification accuracy. We then employ the brain images of\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and extract cortical\nthickness that is represented on the cortical surface to illustrate the use of\nthe two augmentation methods. We demonstrate that augmented cortical thickness\nhas a similar pattern to real data. Second, we show that C-pDA is much faster\nthan LB-eigDA. Last, we show that C-pDA can improve the AD classification\naccuracy of graph-CNN.",

However,\nassessment of the true biological age (BA) remains a daunting task due to the\nlack of reference ground-truth labels. Current BA estimation approaches are\neither restricted to skeletal images or rely on non-imaging modalities that\nyield a whole-body BA assessment. However, various organ systems may exhibit\ndifferent aging characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. In this\ninitial study, we propose a new framework for organ-specific BA estimation\nutilizing 3D magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans. As a first step, this\nframework predicts the chronological age (CA) together with the corresponding\npatient-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. An iterative training algorithm is\nthen utilized to segregate atypical aging patients from the given population\nbased on the predicted uncertainty scores. In this manner, we hypothesize that\ntraining a new model on the remaining population should approximate the true BA\nbehavior.

To address these\nproblems, we propose the BrainBagNet with a position-based gate\n(PG-BrainBagNet), a framework for jointly learning pathological region\nlocalization and AD diagnosis in an end-to-end manner. In advance, as all scans\nare aligned to a template in image processing, the position of brain images can\nbe represented through the 3D Cartesian space shared by the overall MRI scans.\nThe proposed method represents the patch-level response from whole-brain MRI\nscans and discriminative brain-region from position information.

        "summary": "To build a robust and practical content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system\nthat is applicable to a clinical brain MRI database, we propose a new framework\n-- Disease-oriented image embedding with pseudo-scanner standardization\n(DI-PSS) -- that consists of two core techniques, data harmonization and a\ndimension reduction algorithm. Our DI-PSS uses skull stripping and\nCycleGAN-based image transformations that map to a standard brain followed by\ntransformation into a brain image taken with a given reference scanner. Then,\nour 3D convolutioinal autoencoders (3D-CAE) with deep metric learning acquires\na low-dimensional embedding that better reflects the characteristics of the\ndisease. The effectiveness of our proposed framework was tested on the\nT1-weighted MRIs selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\nand the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We confirmed that our PSS\ngreatly reduced the variability of low-dimensional embeddings caused by\ndifferent scanner and datasets. Compared with the baseline condition, our PSS\nreduced the variability in the distance from Alzheimer's disease (AD) to\nclinically normal (CN) and Parkinson disease (PD) cases by 15.8-22.6% and\n18.0-29.9%, respectively. These properties allow DI-PSS to generate lower\ndimensional representations that are more amenable to disease classification.\nIn AD and CN classification experiments based on spectral clustering, PSS\nimproved the average accuracy and macro-F1 by 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.\nGiven the potential of the DI-PSS for harmonizing images scanned by MRI\nscanners that were not used to scan the training data, we expect that the\nDI-PSS is suitable for application to a large number of legacy MRIs scanned in\nheterogeneous environments.",

        "summary": "Existing studies on disease diagnostic models focus either on diagnostic\nmodel learning for performance improvement or on the visual explanation of a\ntrained diagnostic model. We propose a novel learn-explain-reinforce (LEAR)\nframework that unifies diagnostic model learning, visual explanation generation\n(explanation unit), and trained diagnostic model reinforcement (reinforcement\nunit) guided by the visual explanation. For the visual explanation, we generate\na counterfactual map that transforms an input sample to be identified as an\nintended target label. For example, a counterfactual map can localize\nhypothetical abnormalities within a normal brain image that may cause it to be\ndiagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We believe that the generated\ncounterfactual maps represent data-driven and model-induced knowledge about a\ntarget task, i.e., AD diagnosis using structural MRI, which can be a vital\nsource of information to reinforce the generalization of the trained diagnostic\nmodel. To this end, we devise an attention-based feature refinement module with\nthe guidance of the counterfactual maps. The explanation and reinforcement\nunits are reciprocal and can be operated iteratively. Our proposed approach was\nvalidated via qualitative and quantitative analysis on the ADNI dataset. Its\ncomprehensibility and fidelity were demonstrated through ablation studies and\ncomparisons with existing methods.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related dementia. Mild\ncognitive impairment (MCI) is the early stage of cognitive decline before AD.\nIt is crucial to predict the MCI-to-AD conversion for precise management, which\nremains challenging due to the diversity of patients. Previous evidence shows\nthat the brain network generated from diffusion MRI promises to classify\ndementia using deep learning. However, the limited availability of diffusion\nMRI challenges the model training. In this study, we develop a self-supervised\ncontrastive learning approach to generate structural brain networks from\nroutine anatomical MRI under the guidance of diffusion MRI. The generated brain\nnetworks are applied to train a learning framework for predicting the MCI-to-AD\nconversion. Instead of directly modelling the AD brain networks, we train a\ngraph encoder and a variational autoencoder to model the healthy ageing\ntrajectories from brain networks of healthy controls. To predict the MCI-to-AD\nconversion, we further design a recurrent neural networks based approach to\nmodel the longitudinal deviation of patients' brain networks from the healthy\nageing trajectory. Numerical results show that the proposed methods outperform\nthe benchmarks in the prediction task. We also visualize the model\ninterpretation to explain the prediction and identify abnormal changes of white\nmatter tracts.",

A\nbiomarker that provides a quantitative measure of changes in the brain due to\nAD in the early stages would be useful for early diagnosis of AD, but this\nwould involve dealing with large numbers of people because up to 50% of\ndementia sufferers do not receive a formal diagnosis. Thus, there is a need for\naccurate, low-cost, and easy-to-use biomarkers that could be used to detect AD\nin its early stages. Potentially, electroencephalogram (EEG) based biomarkers\ncan play a vital role in early diagnosis of AD as they can fulfill these needs.\nThis is a cross-sectional study that aims to demonstrate the usefulness of EEG\ncomplexity measures in early AD diagnosis. We have focused on the three\ncomplexity methods which have shown the greatest promise in the detection of\nAD, Tsallis entropy (TsEn), Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD), and Lempel-Ziv\ncomplexity (LZC) methods. Unlike previous approaches, in this study, the\ncomplexity measures are derived from EEG frequency bands (instead of the entire\nEEG) as EEG activities have significant association with AD and this has led to\nenhanced performance. The results show that AD patients have significantly\nlower TsEn, HFD, and LZC values for specific EEG frequency bands and for\nspecific EEG channels and that this information can be used to detect AD with a\nsensitivity and specificity of more than 90%.",

Several heatmap methods\nhave been proposed to address this issue and analyze the imaging patterns\nextracted from the deep neural networks, but no quantitative comparison between\nthese methods has been carried out so far. In this work, we explore these\nquestions by deriving heatmaps from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained\nusing T1 MRI scans of the ADNI data set, and by comparing these heatmaps with\nbrain maps corresponding to Support Vector Machines (SVM) coefficients. Three\nprominent heatmap methods are studied: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),\nIntegrated Gradients (IG), and Guided Grad-CAM (GGC). Contrary to prior studies\nwhere the quality of heatmaps was visually or qualitatively assessed, we\nobtained precise quantitative measures by computing overlap with a ground-truth\nmap from a large meta-analysis that combined 77 voxel-based morphometry (VBM)\nstudies independently from ADNI.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder nowadays.\nAmyloid-beta (A$\\beta$) and tau proteins are among the main contributors to the\ndevelopment or propagation of AD. In AD, A$\\beta$ proteins clump together to\nform plaques and disrupt cell functions. On the other hand, the abnormal\nchemical change in the brain helps to build sticky tau tangles that block the\nneuron's transport system. Astrocytes generally maintain a healthy balance in\nthe brain by clearing the A$\\beta$ plaques (toxic A$\\beta$). However,\nover-activated astrocytes release chemokines and cytokines in the presence of\nA$\\beta$ and react to pro-inflammatory cytokines, further increasing the\nproduction of A$\\beta$. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model that\ncan capture astrocytes' dual behaviour. Furthermore, we reveal that the disease\npropagation depends on the current time instance and the disease's earlier\nstatus, called the ``memory effect''. We consider a fractional order network\nmathematical model to capture the influence of such memory effect on AD\npropagation. We have integrated brain connectome data into the model and\nstudied the memory effect, the dual role of astrocytes, and the brain's\nneuronal damage. Based on the pathology, primary, secondary, and mixed\ntauopathies parameters are considered in the model. Due to the mixed tauopathy,\ndifferent brain nodes or regions in the brain connectome accumulate different\ntoxic concentrations of A$\\beta$ and tau proteins. Finally, we explain how the\nmemory effect can slow down the propagation of such toxic proteins in the\nbrain, decreasing the rate of neuronal damage.",

For\nexample, in mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD), brain tissue atrophy can be\ndifficult to observe from pure imaging data, especially without paired AD and\nCognitively Normal ( CN ) data for comparison. This work presents Disease\nDiscovery GAN ( DiDiGAN), a weakly-supervised style-based framework for\ndiscovering and visualising subtle disease features. DiDiGAN learns a disease\nmanifold of AD and CN visual characteristics, and the style codes sampled from\nthis manifold are imposed onto an anatomical structural \"blueprint\" to\nsynthesise paired AD and CN magnetic resonance images (MRIs). To suppress\nnon-disease-related variations between the generated AD and CN pairs, DiDiGAN\nleverages a structural constraint with cycle consistency and anti-aliasing to\nenforce anatomical correspondence. When tested on the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative ( ADNI) dataset, DiDiGAN showed key AD characteristics\n(reduced hippocampal volume, ventricular enlargement, and atrophy of cortical\nstructures) through synthesising paired AD and CN scans.

        "summary": "This paper is motivated by the joint analysis of genetic, imaging, and\nclinical (GIC) data collected in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) study. We propose a regression framework based on partially\nfunctional linear regression models to map high-dimensional GIC-related\npathways for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We develop a joint model selection and\nestimation procedure by embedding imaging data in the reproducing kernel\nHilbert space and imposing the L0 penalty for the coefficients of genetic\nvariables. We apply the proposed method to the ADNI dataset to identify\nimportant features from tens of thousands of genetic polymorphisms (reduced\nfrom millions using a preprocessing step) and study the effects of a certain\nset of informative genetic variants and the baseline hippocampus surface on\nthirteen future cognitive scores measuring different aspects of cognitive\nfunction. We explore the shared and different heritability patterns of these\ncognitive scores. Analysis results suggest that both the hippocampal and\ngenetic data have heterogeneous effects on different scores, with the trend\nthat the value of both hippocampi is negatively associated with the severity of\ncognition deficits. Polygenic effects are observed for all thirteen cognitive\nscores. The well-known APOE4 genotype only explains a small part of cognitive\nfunction. Shared genetic etiology exists, however, greater genetic\nheterogeneity exists within disease classifications after accounting for the\nbaseline diagnosis status. These analyses are useful in further investigation\nof functional mechanisms for AD evolution.",

        "summary": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial in facilitating\npreventive care and to delay further progression. Speech based automatic AD\nscreening systems provide a non-intrusive and more scalable alternative to\nother clinical screening techniques. Textual embedding features produced by\npre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT are widely used in such\nsystems. However, PLM domain fine-tuning is commonly based on the masked word\nor sentence prediction costs that are inconsistent with the back-end AD\ndetection task. To this end, this paper investigates the use of prompt-based\nfine-tuning of PLMs that consistently uses AD classification errors as the\ntraining objective function. Disfluency features based on hesitation or pause\nfiller token frequencies are further incorporated into prompt phrases during\nPLM fine-tuning. The decision voting based combination among systems using\ndifferent PLMs (BERT and RoBERTa) or systems with different fine-tuning\nparadigms (conventional masked-language modelling fine-tuning and prompt-based\nfine-tuning) is further applied. Mean, standard deviation and the maximum among\naccuracy scores over 15 experiment runs are adopted as performance measurements\nfor the AD detection system. Mean detection accuracy of 84.20% (with std 2.09%,\nbest 87.5%) and 82.64% (with std 4.0%, best 89.58%) were obtained using manual\nand ASR speech transcripts respectively on the ADReSS20 test set consisting of\n48 elderly speakers.",

Such a capability, however, is of great\nimportance since it can improve patient management by providing information on\nthe speed of disease progression already at the admission stage, or it can\nenrich the clinical trials with fast progressors and avoid the need for control\narms by the means of digital twins. In this work, we develop a deep learning\nmethod that models the evolution of age-related disease by processing a single\nmedical scan and providing a segmentation of the target anatomy at a requested\nfuture point in time. Our method represents a time-invariant physical process\nand solves a large-scale problem of modeling temporal pixel-level changes\nutilizing NeuralODEs. In addition, we demonstrate the approaches to incorporate\nthe prior domain-specific constraints into our method and define temporal Dice\nloss for learning temporal objectives. To evaluate the applicability of our\napproach across different age-related diseases and imaging modalities, we\ndeveloped and tested the proposed method on the datasets with 967 retinal OCT\nvolumes of 100 patients with Geographic Atrophy, and 2823 brain MRI volumes of\n633 patients with Alzheimer's Disease. For Geographic Atrophy, the proposed\nmethod outperformed the related baseline models in the atrophy growth\nprediction. For Alzheimer's Disease, the proposed method demonstrated\nremarkable performance in predicting the brain ventricle changes induced by the\ndisease, achieving the state-of-the-art result on TADPOLE challenge.",

However, in CRNs, the continuous convolution\noperations used to obtain high-order aggregation features may overlook the\nnon-linear correlation between different brain regions due to the essence of\nconvolution being the linear weighted sum of local elements. Inspired by modern\nneuroscience on the research of covert attention in the nervous system, we\nintroduce the self-attention mechanism, a core module of Transformers, to model\ndiversified covert attention patterns and apply these patterns to reconstruct\nhigh-order sequence features of dFCNs in order to learn complex dynamic changes\nin brain information flow. Therefore, we propose a novel CRN method based on\ndiversified covert attention patterns, DCA-CRN, which combines the advantages\nof CRNs in capturing local spatio-temporal features and sequence change\npatterns, as well as Transformers in learning global and high-order correlation\nfeatures. Experimental results on the ADNI and ADHD-200 datasets demonstrate\nthe prediction performance and generalization ability of our proposed method.",

Deep learning\ntechniques are potent classifiers for AD diagnosis, but most have been unable\nto identify biomarkers because of their lack of interpretability. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a pathway information-based neural network\n(PINNet) to predict AD patients and analyze blood and brain transcriptomic\nsignatures using an interpretable deep learning model. PINNet is a deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) model with pathway prior knowledge from either the Gene Ontology\nor Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. Then, a\nbackpropagation-based model interpretation method was applied to reveal\nessential pathways and genes for predicting AD. We compared the performance of\nPINNet with a DNN model without a pathway. Performances of PINNet outperformed\nor were similar to those of DNN without a pathway using blood and brain gene\nexpressions, respectively. Moreover, PINNet considers more AD-related genes as\nessential features than DNN without a pathway in the learning process. Pathway\nanalysis of protein-protein interaction modules of highly contributed genes\nshowed that AD-related genes in blood were enriched with cell migration,\nPI3K-Akt, MAPK signaling, and apoptosis in blood. The pathways enriched in the\nbrain module included cell migration, PI3K-Akt, MAPK signaling, apoptosis,\nprotein ubiquitination, and t-cell activation.

The\nnon-informative censoring mechanism is tested and confirmed based on\nconditional-vs-marginal entropies evaluated upon contingency tables built by\nthe Redistribute-to-the-right algorithm. The Categorical Exploratory Data\nAnalysis (CEDA) paradigm is applied to evaluate conditional entropy-based\nassociative patterns between the categorized response variable against 16\ncategorized covariable variables all having 4 categories. Two order-1 global\nmajor factors: V9 (MEM-mean) and V8 (ADAS13.bl) are selected sharing the\nhighest amounts of mutual information with the response variable. This heavily\ncensored data set is analyzed by Cox's proportional hazard (PH) modeling.\nComparisons of PH and CEDA results on a global scale are complicated under the\nstructural dependency of covariate features. To alleviate such complications,\nV9 and V8 are taken as two potential perspectives of heterogeneity and the\nentire collections of subjects are divided into two sets of four\nsub-collections. CEDA major factor selection protocol is applied to all\nsub-collections to figure out which features provide extra information. Graphic\ndisplays are developed to explicitly unravel conditional entropy expansions\nupon perspectives of heterogeneity in ADNI data. On the local scale, PH\nanalysis is carried out and results are compared with CEDA's. We conclude that,\nwhen facing structural dependency among covariates and heterogeneity in data,\nCEDA and its major factor selection provide significant merits for manifesting\ndata's multiscale information content.",

        "summary": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) can identify subtle brain\nchanges due to its high contrast for soft tissues and high spatial resolution.\nIt has been widely used in diagnosing neurological brain diseases, such as\nAlzheimer disease (AD). However, the size of 3D high-resolution data poses a\nsignificant challenge for data analysis and processing. Since only a few areas\nof the brain show structural changes highly associated with AD, the patch-based\nmethods dividing the whole image data into several small regular patches have\nshown promising for more efficient sMRI-based image analysis. The major\nchallenges of the patch-based methods on sMRI include identifying the\ndiscriminative patches, combining features from the discrete discriminative\npatches, and designing appropriate classifiers. This work proposes a novel\npatch-based deep learning network (sMRI-PatchNet) with explainable patch\nlocalisation and selection for AD diagnosis using sMRI. Specifically, it\nconsists of two primary components: 1) A fast and efficient explainable patch\nselection mechanism for determining the most discriminative patches based on\ncomputing the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) contribution to a transfer\nlearning model for AD diagnosis on massive medical data; and 2) A novel\npatch-based network for extracting deep features and AD classfication from the\nselected patches with position embeddings to retain position information,\ncapable of capturing the global and local information of inter- and\nintra-patches.

First, we use a combination of\nself-supervised and supervised paradigms to create an effective brain\nfingerprint from MRI scans that can be used for real-time image retrieval.\nSecond, we use a special weighting function to guide the training and improve\nmodel convergence. Third, we introduce new imaging transformations to improve\nretrieval robustness in the presence of intensity variations (i.e. different\nscan contrasts), and to account for age and disease progression in patients. We\ntested DeepBrainPrint on a large dataset of T1-weighted brain MRIs from the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on a synthetic dataset\ndesigned to evaluate retrieval performance with different image modalities. Our\nresults show that DeepBrainPrint outperforms previous methods, including simple\nsimilarity metrics and more advanced contrastive deep learning frameworks.",

        "summary": "Transfer learning has been widely utilized to mitigate the data scarcity\nproblem in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventional transfer\nlearning relies on re-using models trained on AD-irrelevant tasks such as\nnatural image classification. However, it often leads to negative transfer due\nto the discrepancy between the non-medical source and target medical domains.\nTo address this, we present evidence-empowered transfer learning for AD\ndiagnosis. Unlike conventional approaches, we leverage an AD-relevant auxiliary\ntask, namely morphological change prediction, without requiring additional MRI\ndata. In this auxiliary task, the diagnosis model learns the evidential and\ntransferable knowledge from morphological features in MRI scans.

        "summary": "Transfer learning has remarkably improved computer vision. These advances\nalso promise improvements in neuroimaging, where training set sizes are often\nsmall. However, various difficulties arise in directly applying models\npretrained on natural images to radiologic images, such as MRIs. In particular,\na mismatch in the input space (2D images vs. 3D MRIs) restricts the direct\ntransfer of models, often forcing us to consider only a few MRI slices as\ninput. To this end, we leverage the 2D-Slice-CNN architecture of Gupta et al.\n(2021), which embeds all the MRI slices with 2D encoders (neural networks that\ntake 2D image input) and combines them via permutation-invariant layers. With\nthe insight that the pretrained model can serve as the 2D encoder, we\ninitialize the 2D encoder with ImageNet pretrained weights that outperform\nthose initialized and trained from scratch on two neuroimaging tasks -- brain\nage prediction on the UK Biobank dataset and Alzheimer's disease detection on\nthe ADNI dataset. Further, we improve the modeling capabilities of 2D-Slice\nmodels by incorporating spatial information through position embeddings, which\ncan improve the performance in some cases.",

        "summary": "Nearly 300,000 older adults experience a hip fracture every year, the\nmajority of which occur following a fall. Unfortunately, recovery after\nfall-related trauma such as hip fracture is poor, where older adults diagnosed\nwith Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) spend a particularly long\ntime in hospitals or rehabilitation facilities during the post-operative\nrecuperation period. Because older adults value functional recovery and\nspending time at home versus facilities as key outcomes after hospitalization,\nidentifying factors that influence days spent at home after hospitalization is\nimperative. While several individual-level factors have been identified, the\ncharacteristics of the treating hospital have recently been identified as\ncontributors. However, few methodological rigorous approaches are available to\nhelp overcome potential sources of bias such as hospital-level unmeasured\nconfounders, informative hospital size, and loss to follow-up due to death.\nThis article develops a useful tool equipped with unsupervised learning to\nsimultaneously handle statistical complexities that are often encountered in\nhealth services research, especially when using large administrative claims\ndatabases. The proposed estimator has a closed form, thus only requiring light\ncomputation load in a large-scale study. We further develop its asymptotic\nproperties that can be used to make statistical inference in practice.\nExtensive simulation studies demonstrate superiority of the proposed estimator\ncompared to existing estimators.",

        "summary": "With the global population aging rapidly, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is\nparticularly prominent in older adults, which has an insidious onset and leads\nto a gradual, irreversible deterioration in cognitive domains (memory,\ncommunication, etc.). Speech-based AD detection opens up the possibility of\nwidespread screening and timely disease intervention. Recent advances in\npre-trained models motivate AD detection modeling to shift from low-level\nfeatures to high-level representations. This paper presents several efficient\nmethods to extract better AD-related cues from high-level acoustic and\nlinguistic features. Based on these features, the paper also proposes a novel\ntask-oriented approach by modeling the relationship between the participants'\ndescription and the cognitive task. Experiments are carried out on the ADReSS\ndataset in a binary classification setup, and models are evaluated on the\nunseen test set. Results and comparison with recent literature demonstrate the\nefficiency and superior performance of proposed acoustic, linguistic and\ntask-oriented methods. The findings also show the importance of semantic and\nsyntactic information, and feasibility of automation and generalization with\nthe promising audio-only and task-oriented methods for the AD detection task.",

        "summary": "Neuroimaging of large populations is valuable to identify factors that\npromote or resist brain disease, and to assist diagnosis, subtyping, and\nprognosis. Data-driven models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have\nincreasingly been applied to brain images to perform diagnostic and prognostic\ntasks by learning robust features. Vision transformers (ViT) - a new class of\ndeep learning architectures - have emerged in recent years as an alternative to\nCNNs for several computer vision applications. Here we tested variants of the\nViT architecture for a range of desired neuroimaging downstream tasks based on\ndifficulty, in this case for sex and Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification\nbased on 3D brain MRI. In our experiments, two vision transformer architecture\nvariants achieved an AUC of 0.987 for sex and 0.892 for AD classification,\nrespectively. We independently evaluated our models on data from two benchmark\nAD datasets. We achieved a performance boost of 5% and 9-10% upon fine-tuning\nvision transformer models pre-trained on synthetic (generated by a latent\ndiffusion model) and real MRI scans, respectively. Our main contributions\ninclude testing the effects of different ViT training strategies including\npre-training, data augmentation and learning rate warm-ups followed by\nannealing, as pertaining to the neuroimaging domain. These techniques are\nessential for training ViT-like models for neuroimaging applications where\ntraining data is usually limited. We also analyzed the effect of the amount of\ntraining data utilized on the test-time performance of the ViT via data-model\nscaling curves.",

        "summary": "Brain structural connectivity, capturing the white matter fiber tracts among\nbrain regions inferred by diffusion MRI (dMRI), provides a unique\ncharacterization of brain anatomical organization. One fundamental question to\naddress with structural connectivity is how to properly summarize and perform\nstatistical inference for a group-level connectivity architecture, for\ninstance, under different sex groups, or disease cohorts. Existing analyses\ncommonly summarize group-level brain connectivity by a simple entry-wise sample\nmean or median across individual brain connectivity matrices. However, such a\nheuristic approach fully ignores the associations among structural connections\nand the topological properties of brain networks. In this project, we propose a\nlatent space-based generative network model to estimate group-level brain\nconnectivity. We name our method the attributes-informed brain connectivity\n(ABC) model, which compared with existing group-level connectivity estimations,\n(1) offers an interpretable latent space representation of the group-level\nconnectivity, (2) incorporates the anatomical knowledge of nodes and tests its\nco-varying relationship with connectivity and (3) quantifies the uncertainty\nand evaluates the likelihood of the estimated group-level effects against\nchance. We devise a novel Bayesian MCMC algorithm to estimate the model. By\napplying the ABC model to study brain structural connectivity stratified by sex\namong Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects and healthy controls incorporating the\nanatomical attributes (volume, thickness and area) on nodes, our method shows\nsuperior predictive power on out-of-sample structural connectivity and\nidentifies meaningful sex-specific network neuromarkers for AD.",

        "summary": "The abnormal aggregation of extracellular amyloid-$\\beta$ (A\\beta) in senile\nplaques resulting in calcium (Ca^{+2}) dyshomeostasis is one of the primary\nsymptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Significant research efforts have been\ndevoted in the past to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms\ndriving A\\beta deposition and Ca^{+2} dysregulation. To better understand this\ninteraction, we report a novel stochastic model where we analyze the positive\nfeedback loop between A\\beta and Ca^{+2} using ADNI data. A good therapeutic\ntreatment plan for AD requires precise predictions. Stochastic models offer an\nappropriate framework for modelling AD since AD studies are observational in\nnature and involve regular patient visits. The etiology of AD may be described\nas a multi-state disease process using the approximate Bayesian computation\nmethod. So, utilizing ADNI data from $2$-year visits for AD patients, we employ\nthis method to investigate the interplay between A\\beta and Ca^{+2} levels at\nvarious disease development phases. Incorporating the ADNI data in our\nphysics-based Bayesian model, we discovered that a sufficiently large\ndisruption in either A\\beta metabolism or intracellular Ca^{+2} homeostasis\ncauses the relative growth rate in both Ca^{+2} and A\\beta, which corresponds\nto the development of AD. The imbalance of Ca^{+2} ions causes A\\beta disorders\nby directly or indirectly affecting a variety of cellular and subcellular\nprocesses, and the altered homeostasis may worsen the abnormalities of Ca^{+2}\nion transportation and deposition. This suggests that altering the Ca^{+2}\nbalance or the balance between A\\beta and Ca^{+2} by chelating them may be able\nto reduce disorders associated with AD and open up new research possibilities\nfor AD therapy.",

        "summary": "Detecting duplicate patient participation in clinical trials is a major\nchallenge because repeated patients can undermine the credibility and accuracy\nof the trial's findings and result in significant health and financial risks.\nDeveloping accurate automated speaker verification (ASV) models is crucial to\nverify the identity of enrolled individuals and remove duplicates, but the size\nand quality of data influence ASV performance. However, there has been limited\ninvestigation into the factors that can affect ASV capabilities in clinical\nenvironments. In this paper, we bridge the gap by conducting analysis of how\nparticipant demographic characteristics, audio quality criteria, and severity\nlevel of Alzheimer's disease (AD) impact the performance of ASV utilizing a\ndataset of speech recordings from 659 participants with varying levels of AD,\nobtained through multiple speech tasks. Our results indicate that ASV\nperformance: 1) is slightly better on male speakers than on female speakers; 2)\ndegrades for individuals who are above 70 years old; 3) is comparatively better\nfor non-native English speakers than for native English speakers; 4) is\nnegatively affected by clinician interference, noisy background, and unclear\nparticipant speech; 5) tends to decrease with an increase in the severity level\nof AD. Our study finds that voice biometrics raise fairness concerns as certain\nsubgroups exhibit different ASV performances owing to their inherent voice\ncharacteristics. Moreover, the performance of ASV is influenced by the quality\nof speech recordings, which underscores the importance of improving the data\ncollection settings in clinical trials.",

        "summary": "Using kinematic properties of handwriting to support the diagnosis of\nneurodegenerative disease is a real challenge: non-invasive detection\ntechniques combined with machine learning approaches promise big steps forward\nin this research field. In literature, the tasks proposed focused on different\ncognitive skills to elicitate handwriting movements. In particular, the meaning\nand phonology of words to copy can compromise writing fluency. In this paper,\nwe investigated how word semantics and phonology affect the handwriting of\npeople affected by Alzheimer's disease. To this aim, we used the data from six\nhandwriting tasks, each requiring copying a word belonging to one of the\nfollowing categories: regular (have a predictable phoneme-grapheme\ncorrespondence, e.g., cat), non-regular (have atypical phoneme-grapheme\ncorrespondence, e.g., laugh), and non-word (non-meaningful pronounceable letter\nstrings that conform to phoneme-grapheme conversion rules). We analyzed the\ndata using a machine learning approach by implementing four well-known and\nwidely-used classifiers and feature selection. The experimental results showed\nthat the feature selection allowed us to derive a different set of highly\ndistinctive features for each word type. Furthermore, non-regular words needed,\non average, more features but achieved excellent classification performance:\nthe best result was obtained on a non-regular, reaching an accuracy close to\n90%.",

Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection,\nwhich serves as a paradigmatic example of challenging problem in healthcare. We\ninvestigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques and model\ncomplexity on the overall performance. We consider MRI data from ADNI dataset\nto address a classification problem employing 3D Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN). The experiments are designed to compensate for data scarcity and initial\nrandom parameters by utilizing cross-validation and multiple training trials.\nWithin this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three\ndifferent data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures,\neach varying in the number of convolutional layers. Specifically, the\naugmentation strategies are based on affine transformations, such as zoom,\nshift, and rotation, applied concurrently or separately. The combined effect of\ndata augmentation and model complexity leads to a variation in prediction\nperformance up to 10% of accuracy. When affine transformation are applied\nseparately, the model is more accurate, independently from the adopted\narchitecture. For all strategies, the model accuracy followed a concave\nbehavior at increasing number of convolutional layers, peaking at an\nintermediate value of layers. The best model (8 CL, (B)) is the most stable\nacross cross-validation folds and training trials, reaching excellent\nperformance both on the testing set and on an external test set.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that\nprecedes progressive and irreversible dementia; thus, predicting its\nprogression over time is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Numerous\nstudies have implemented structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to model\nAD progression, focusing on three integral aspects: (i) temporal variability,\n(ii) incomplete observations, and (iii) temporal geometric characteristics.\nHowever, deep learning-based approaches regarding data variability and sparsity\nhave yet to consider inherent geometrical properties sufficiently. The ordinary\ndifferential equation-based geometric modeling method (ODE-RGRU) has recently\nemerged as a promising strategy for modeling time-series data by intertwining a\nrecurrent neural network and an ODE in Riemannian space. Despite its\nachievements, ODE-RGRU encounters limitations when extrapolating positive\ndefinite symmetric metrics from incomplete samples, leading to feature reverse\noccurrences that are particularly problematic, especially within the clinical\nfacet. Therefore, this study proposes a novel geometric learning approach that\nmodels longitudinal MRI biomarkers and cognitive scores by combining three\nmodules: topological space shift, ODE-RGRU, and trajectory estimation. We have\nalso developed a training algorithm that integrates manifold mapping with\nmonotonicity constraints to reflect measurement transition irreversibility. We\nverify our proposed method's efficacy by predicting clinical labels and\ncognitive scores over time in regular and irregular settings. Furthermore, we\nthoroughly analyze our proposed framework through an ablation study.",

Detecting AD in all its\npresymptomatic and symptomatic stages is crucial for early intervention and\ntreatment.

Moreover, to tackle the challenge of\ndetecting subtle changes in brain volume, we transform images into the Jacobian\ndomain (JD) to enhance both accuracy and robustness in our classification.\nUsing MRI and CT images from the OASIS-3 dataset, our experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the ELF approach in classifying AD into four stages with\nan accuracy of 97.19%.",

        "summary": "Identifying and utilising various biomarkers for tracking Alzheimer's disease\n(AD) progression have received many recent attentions and enable helping\nclinicians make the prompt decisions. Traditional progression models focus on\nextracting morphological biomarkers in regions of interest (ROIs) from MRI/PET\nimages, such as regional average cortical thickness and regional volume. They\nare effective but ignore the relationships between brain ROIs over time, which\nwould lead to synergistic deterioration. For exploring the synergistic\ndeteriorating relationship between these biomarkers, in this paper, we propose\na novel spatio-temporal similarity measure based multi-task learning approach\nfor effectively predicting AD progression and sensitively capturing the\ncritical relationships between biomarkers. Specifically, we firstly define a\ntemporal measure for estimating the magnitude and velocity of biomarker change\nover time, which indicate a changing trend(temporal). Converting this trend\ninto the vector, we then compare this variability between biomarkers in a\nunified vector space(spatial). The experimental results show that compared with\ndirectly ROI based learning, our proposed method is more effective in\npredicting disease progression. Our method also enables performing longitudinal\nstability selection to identify the changing relationships between biomarkers,\nwhich play a key role in disease progression. We prove that the synergistic\ndeteriorating biomarkers between cortical volumes or surface areas have a\nsignificant effect on the cognitive prediction.",

This approach was validated\nthrough secondary structure analyses of unexposed control samples, for which\ncomparisons with other values available in the literature could be conducted.\nSubsequently, using this validated method, we present novel findings of\nstatistically significant alterations in the secondary structures of\nNIR-exposed tubulin, characterized by a notable decrease in alpha-helix content\nand a concurrent increase in beta-sheets compared to the control samples. The\nalpha-helix to beta-sheet transition suggests that PBM reduces microtubule\nstability and introduces dynamism to allow for the remodeling and,\nconsequently, refreshing of microtubule structures. This newly discovered\nmechanism could have implications for reducing the risks associated with brain\naging, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease.",

Through evaluations on private and public datasets,\nwe have demonstrated that Polar-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods and provides more valuable pathological evidence for the association\nbetween retinal vascular changes and AD.

        "summary": "Tensor-based representations are being increasingly used to represent complex\ndata types such as imaging data, due to their appealing properties such as\ndimension reduction and the preservation of spatial information. Recently,\nthere is a growing literature on using Bayesian scalar-on-tensor regression\ntechniques that use tensor-based representations for high-dimensional and\nspatially distributed covariates to predict continuous outcomes. However\nsurprisingly, there is limited development on corresponding Bayesian\nclassification methods relying on tensor-valued covariates. Standard approaches\nthat vectorize the image are not desirable due to the loss of spatial\nstructure, and alternate methods that use extracted features from the image in\nthe predictive model may suffer from information loss. We propose a novel data\naugmentation-based Bayesian classification approach relying on tensor-valued\ncovariates, with a focus on imaging predictors. We propose two data\naugmentation schemes, one resulting in a support vector machine (SVM)\nclassifier, and another yielding a logistic regression classifier. While both\ntypes of classifiers have been proposed independently in literature, our\ncontribution is to extend such existing methodology to accommodate\nhigh-dimensional tensor valued predictors that involve low rank decompositions\nof the coefficient matrix while preserving the spatial information in the\nimage. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for\nimplementing these methods. Simulation studies show significant improvements in\nclassification accuracy and parameter estimation compared to routinely used\nclassification methods. We further illustrate our method in a neuroimaging\napplication using cortical thickness MRI data from Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative, with results displaying better classification accuracy\nthroughout several classification tasks.",

In this paper, I introduce a HIPAA\ncompliant framework that can train from distributed data. I then propose a\nmultimodal vertical federated model for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection, a\nserious neurodegenerative condition that can cause dementia, severely impairing\nbrain function and hindering simple tasks, especially without preventative\ncare. This vertical federated learning (VFL) model offers a distributed\narchitecture that enables collaborative learning across diverse sources of\nmedical data while respecting privacy constraints imposed by HIPAA. The VFL\narchitecture proposed herein offers a novel distributed architecture, enabling\ncollaborative learning across diverse sources of medical data while respecting\nstatutory privacy constraints. By leveraging multiple modalities of data, the\nrobustness and accuracy of AD detection can be enhanced. This model not only\ncontributes to the advancement of federated learning techniques but also holds\npromise for overcoming the hurdles posed by data segmentation in medical\nresearch.",

This decline manifests in various mental faculties such as attention,\nmemory, and higher-order cognitive functions, severely impacting an\nindividual's ability to comprehend information, acquire new knowledge, and\ncommunicate effectively. One of the tasks influenced by cognitive impairments\nis handwriting. By analyzing specific features of handwriting, including\npressure, velocity, and spatial organization, researchers can detect subtle\nchanges that may indicate early-stage cognitive impairments, particularly AD.\nRecent developments in classical artificial intelligence (AI) methods have\nshown promise in detecting AD through handwriting analysis. However, as the\ndataset size increases, these AI approaches demand greater computational\nresources, and diagnoses are often affected by limited classical vector spaces\nand feature correlations. Recent studies have shown that quantum computing\ntechnologies, developed by harnessing the unique properties of quantum\nparticles such as superposition and entanglement, can not only address the\naforementioned problems but also accelerate complex data analysis and enable\nmore efficient processing of large datasets. In this study, we propose a\nvariational quantum classifier with fewer circuit elements to facilitate early\nAD diagnosis based on handwriting data.

Here, the rich potential for insightful,\ndiscriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal\nresolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious\nnature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel\nmethodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST)\nfunctional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is\naveraged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term\nMemory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing\ninformation on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a\nfilter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional\nconnectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method\naccurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)\nbetween two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods\nfail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term\nmemory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's\ndisease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task\nwith no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range.

In this context, we\nconstruct a novel framework, namely Hierarchical Attention-Free Transformer\n(HAFFormer), to better deal with long speech for AD detection.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans\naged 65 and older. Screening and early detection of AD and related dementias\n(ADRD) are critical for timely intervention and for identifying clinical trial\nparticipants. The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs)\noffers an important resource for developing ADRD screening tools such as\nmachine learning based predictive models. Recent advancements in large language\nmodels (LLMs) demonstrate their unprecedented capability of encoding knowledge\nand performing reasoning, which offers them strong potential for enhancing risk\nprediction. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that augments risk prediction\nby leveraging the few-shot inference power of LLMs to make predictions on cases\nwhere traditional supervised learning methods (SLs) may not excel.\nSpecifically, we develop a collaborative pipeline that combines SLs and LLMs\nvia a confidence-driven decision-making mechanism, leveraging the strengths of\nSLs in clear-cut cases and LLMs in more complex scenarios. We evaluate this\npipeline using a real-world EHR data warehouse from Oregon Health \\& Science\nUniversity (OHSU) Hospital, encompassing EHRs from over 2.5 million patients\nand more than 20 million patient encounters. Our results show that our proposed\napproach effectively combines the power of SLs and LLMs, offering significant\nimprovements in predictive performance. This advancement holds promise for\nrevolutionizing ADRD screening and early detection practices, with potential\nimplications for better strategies of patient management and thus improving\nhealthcare.",

Desta-bilisation\nstudies of the amyloid-peptide by various natural molecules are of the utmost\nrele-vance due to their enormous potential as neuroprotective and therapeutic\nagents for AD. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on the U-shaped\npentamers of amyloidogenic protofilament intermediates to investigate the\ndestabilisation mechanism in the presence of Bai-calein (BCL), a naturally\noccurring flavonoid. We found that the BCL molecule formed strong hydrophobic\ncontacts with non-polar residues of the protofibril. Upon binding, it competed\nwith the native hydrophobic contacts of the A-beta protein. BCL loosened the\ntight packing of the hydrophobic core of the protofibril by disrupting the\ninter-chain salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. The decrease in the structural\nstability of A-beta protofibrils was confirmed through the en-hanced root mean\nsquare deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration and solvent accessible surface area\n(SASA), and reduced beta-sheet content. PCA indicated that the presence of the\nBCL mole-cule intensified protofibril motions, particularly affecting residues\nin Chain A and B regions. Our findings propose that BCL would be a potent\ndestabiliser of A-beta protofilament, and may be considered as a therapeutic\nagent in treating AD.",

Understanding the sequence of preclinical\nbiomarker changes provides a critical opportunity for early diagnosis and\neffective intervention prior to significant loss of patients' brain functions.\nThe main challenge to early detection lies in the absence of direct observation\nof the disease state and the considerable variability in both biomarkers and\ndisease dynamics among individuals. Recent research hypothesized the existence\nof subgroups with distinct biomarker patterns due to co-morbidities and degrees\nof brain resilience. Our ability to early diagnose and intervene during the\npreclinical stage of neurodegenerative diseases will be enhanced by further\ninsights into heterogeneity in the biomarker-disease relationship. In this\npaper, we focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and attempt to identify the\nsystematic patterns within the heterogeneous AD biomarker-disease cascade.\nSpecifically, we quantify the disease progression using a dynamic latent\nvariable whose mixture distribution represents patient subgroups. Model\nestimation uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the number of clusters determined\nby the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). We report simulation studies that\ninvestigate the performance of the proposed model in finite sample settings\nthat are similar to our motivating application. We apply the proposed model to\nthe BIOCARD data, a longitudinal study that was conducted over two decades\namong individuals who were initially cognitively normal. Our application yields\nevidence consistent with the hypothetical model of biomarker dynamics presented\nin Jack et al. (2013).

However, existing\nmultimodal methods for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily rely on\nimaging and sometimes genetic data, often neglecting the transcriptomic basis\nof brain. Furthermore, while striving to integrate complementary information\nbetween modalities, most studies overlook the informativeness disparities\nbetween modalities. Here, we propose TMM, a trusted multiview multimodal graph\nattention framework for AD diagnosis, using extensive brain-wide\ntranscriptomics and imaging data. First, we construct view-specific brain\nregional co-function networks (RRIs) from transcriptomics and multimodal\nradiomics data to incorporate interaction information from both biomolecular\nand imaging perspectives. Next, we apply graph attention (GAT) processing to\neach RRI network to produce graph embeddings and employ cross-modal attention\nto fuse transcriptomics-derived embedding with each imagingderived embedding.\nFinally, a novel true-false-harmonized class probability (TFCP) strategy is\ndesigned to assess and adaptively adjust the prediction confidence of each\nmodality for AD diagnosis. We evaluate TMM using the AHBA database with\nbrain-wide transcriptomics data and the ADNI database with three imaging\nmodalities (AV45-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM-MRI). The results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method in identifying AD, EMCI, and LMCI compared to\nstate-of-the-arts. Code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/Yaolab-fantastic/TMM.",

However, most linear models in imaging genetics didn't explicitly\nmodel the inner relationship among QTs, which might miss some potential\nefficiency gains from information borrowing across brain regions. In this work,\nwe developed a novel Bayesian regression framework for identifying significant\nassociations between QTs and genetic markers while explicitly modeling spatial\ndependency between QTs, with the main contributions as follows. Firstly, we\ndeveloped a spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to\naccount for dependencies between QTs. We incorporated a population-level mixed\neffects term into the model, taking full advantage of the dependent structure\nof brain imaging-derived QTs. Secondly, we implemented the model in the\nBayesian framework and derived a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to\nachieve the model inference. Further, we incorporated the MCMC samples with the\nCauchy combination test (CCT) to examine the association between SNPs and QTs,\nwhich avoided computationally intractable multi-test issues. The simulation\nstudies indicated improved power of our proposed model compared to classic\nmodels where inner dependencies of QTs were not modeled.

However, since AD is heterogeneous and has\nmultiple subtypes, the pathological mechanism of AD remains not fully\nunderstood and may vary from patient to patient. Due to the lack of such\nunderstanding, it is difficult to comprehensively and effectively assess the\nsaliency map of AD classifier. In this paper, we utilize the anatomical\nsegmentation to allocate saliency values into different brain regions. By\nplotting the distributions of saliency maps corresponding to AD and NC (Normal\nControl), we can gain a comprehensive view of the model's decisions process. In\norder to leverage the fact that the brain volume shrinkage happens in AD\npatients during disease progression, we define a new evaluation metric, brain\nvolume change score (VCS), by computing the average Pearson correlation of the\nbrain volume changes and the saliency values of a model in different brain\nregions for each patient. Thus, the VCS metric can help us gain some knowledge\nof how saliency maps resulting from different models relate to the changes of\nthe volumes across different regions in the whole brain. We trained candidate\nmodels on the ADNI dataset and tested on three different datasets. Our results\nindicate: (i) models with higher VCSs tend to demonstrate saliency maps with\nmore details relevant to the AD pathology, (ii) using gradient-based\nadversarial training strategies such as FGSM and stochastic masking can improve\nthe VCSs of the models.",

        "summary": "Graph theoretical methods have proven valuable for investigating alterations\nin both anatomical and functional brain connectivity networks during\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that representing brain\nnetworks in a suitable geometric space can better capture their connectivity\nstructure. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize brain\nconnectivity changes using low dimensional, informative representations of\nnetworks in a latent geometric space. Specifically, the networks are embedded\nin a polar representation of the hyperbolic plane, the hyperbolic disk. Here,\nwe use a geometric score, entirely based on the computation of distances\nbetween nodes in the latent space, to measure the effect of a perturbation on\nthe nodes. Precisely, the score is a local measure of distortion in the\ngeometric neighborhood of a node following a perturbation. The method is\napplied to a brain network dataset of patients with AD and healthy\nparticipants, derived from diffusion weighted (DWI) and functional (fMRI)\nmagnetic resonance imaging scans. We show that, compared with standard graph\nmeasures, our method more accurately identifies the brain regions most affected\nby neurodegeneration. Notably, the abnormalities detected in memory related and\nfrontal areas are robust across multiple brain parcellation scales. Finally,\nour findings suggest that the geometric perturbation score could serve as a\npotential biomarker for characterizing the progression of the disease.",

        "summary": "The current clinical diagnosis framework of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves\nmultiple modalities acquired from multiple diagnosis stages, each with distinct\nusage and cost. Previous AD diagnosis research has predominantly focused on how\nto directly fuse multiple modalities for an end-to-end one-stage diagnosis,\nwhich practically requires a high cost in data acquisition. Moreover, a\nsignificant part of these methods diagnose AD without considering clinical\nguideline and cannot offer accurate sub-type diagnosis. In this paper, by\nexploring inter-correlation among multiple modalities, we propose a novel\nprogressive AD sub-type diagnosis framework, aiming to give diagnosis results\nbased on easier-to-access modalities in earlier low-cost stages, instead of\nmodalities from all stages. Specifically, first, we design 1) a text\ndisentanglement network for better processing tabular data collected in the\ninitial stage, and 2) a modality fusion module for fusing multi-modality\nfeatures separately. Second, we align features from modalities acquired in\nearlier low-cost stage(s) with later high-cost stage(s) to give accurate\ndiagnosis without actual modality acquisition in later-stage(s) for saving\ncost. Furthermore, we follow the clinical guideline to align features at each\nstage for achieving sub-type diagnosis. Third, we leverage a progressive\nclassifier that can progressively include additional acquired modalities (if\nneeded) for diagnosis, to achieve the balance between diagnosis cost and\ndiagnosis performance. We evaluate our proposed framework on large diverse\npublic and in-home datasets (8280 in total) and achieve superior performance\nover state-of-the-art methods. Our codes will be released after the acceptance.",

The most recent\ndevelopment in this detection method highlights the use of graph neural network\n(GNN) as the brain functionality analysis. In this paper, we proposed a stack\nof spatio-temporal feature extraction and graph generation based AD\nclassification model using resting state fMRI. The proposed multi-level\ngenerated connectome (MLC) based graph convolutional network (GCN) (MLC-GCN)\ncontains a multi-graph generation block and a GCN prediction block. The\nmulti-graph generation block consists of a hierarchy of spatio-temporal feature\nextraction layers for extracting spatio-temporal rsfMRI features at different\ndepths and building the corresponding connectomes. The GCN prediction block\ntakes the learned multi-level connectomes to build and optimize GCNs at each\nlevel and concatenates the learned graphical features as the final predicting\nfeatures for AD classification. Through independent cohort validations, MLC-GCN\nshows better performance for differentiating MCI, AD, and normal aging than\nstate-of-art GCN and rsfMRI based AD classifiers. The proposed MLC-GCN also\nshowed high explainability in terms of learning clinically reasonable\nconnectome node and connectivity features from two independent datasets.

Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL\nmodels in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results,\nespecially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions.

        "summary": "Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient\ntool to support neurologists in the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual feature engineering or\ndata transformation. While such techniques may provide benefits when working\nwith small-scale datasets, they often lead to information loss and distortion\nwhen applied to large-scale data, ultimately limiting model performance.\nMoreover, the limited subject scale and demographic diversity of datasets used\nin prior studies hinder comprehensive evaluation of model robustness and\ngeneralizability, thus restricting their applicability in real-world clinical\nsettings. To address these challenges, we propose ADformer, a novel\nmulti-granularity spatial-temporal transformer designed to capture both\ntemporal and spatial features from raw EEG signals, enabling effective\nend-to-end representation learning. Our model introduces multi-granularity\nembedding strategies across both spatial and temporal dimensions, leveraging a\ntwo-stage intra-inter granularity self-attention mechanism to learn both local\npatterns within each granularity and global dependencies across granularities.\nWe evaluate ADformer on 4 large-scale datasets comprising a total of 1,713\nsubjects, representing one of the largest corpora for EEG-based AD detection to\ndate, under a cross-validated, subject-independent setting. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that ADformer consistently outperforms existing methods,\nachieving subject-level F1 scores of 92.82%, 89.83%, 67.99%, and 83.98% on the\n4 datasets, respectively, in distinguishing AD from healthy control (HC)\nsubjects.",

We examined this issue in the ADreSSo dataset, derived\nfrom the widely used Pitt corpus. We show that systems based on two acoustic\nfeatures, MFCCs and Wav2vec 2.0 embeddings, can discriminate AD patients from\ncontrols with above-chance performance when using only the non-speech part of\nthe audio signals.

FTD and AD display unique traits in their onset, progression, and\ntreatment responses. In particular, FTD often faces a prolonged diagnostic\nprocess and is commonly misdiagnosed with AD due to overlapping symptoms. This\nstudy utilizes a complex network model of brain electrical activity using\nresting-state EEG recordings to address the misdiagnosis. It compares the\nnetwork organization between AD and FTD, highlighting connectivity differences\nand examining the significance of EEG signals across frequency bands in\ndistinguishing AD and FTD. The publicly available EEG dataset of 36 AD and 23\nFTD patients is utilized for analyses. Cross-plot transition entropy (CPTE) is\nemployed to measure synchronization between EEG signals and construct\nconnection matrices. CPTE offers advantages in parameter setting, computational\nefficiency, and robustness. The analysis reveals significantly different\nclustering coefficients (CC), subgraph centrality (SC), and eigenvector\ncentrality (EC) between the two groups. FTD shows higher connectivity,\nparticularly in delta, theta, and gamma bands, owing to lower\nneurodegeneration. The CPTE-based network parameters effectively classify the\ntwo groups with an accuracy of 87.58\\%, with the gamma band demonstrating the\nhighest accuracy of 92.87%. Consequently, CPTE-based, complex network analysis\nof EEG data from AD and FTD patients reveals significant differences in brain\nnetwork organization.

        "title": "Swin-BERT: A Feature Fusion System designed for Speech-based Alzheimer's\n  Dementia Detection",
        "summary": "Speech is usually used for constructing an automatic Alzheimer's dementia\n(AD) detection system, as the acoustic and linguistic abilities show a decline\nin people living with AD at the early stages. However, speech includes not only\nAD-related local and global information but also other information unrelated to\ncognitive status, such as age and gender. In this paper, we propose a\nspeech-based system named Swin-BERT for automatic dementia detection. For the\nacoustic part, the shifted windows multi-head attention that proposed to\nextract local and global information from images, is used for designing our\nacoustic-based system. To decouple the effect of age and gender on acoustic\nfeature extraction, they are used as an extra input of the designed acoustic\nsystem. For the linguistic part, the rhythm-related information, which varies\nsignificantly between people living with and without AD, is removed while\ntranscribing the audio recordings into transcripts. To compensate for the\nremoved rhythm-related information, the character-level transcripts are\nproposed to be used as the extra input of a word-level BERT-style system.\nFinally, the Swin-BERT combines the acoustic features learned from our proposed\nacoustic-based system with our linguistic-based system. The experiments are\nbased on the two datasets provided by the international dementia detection\nchallenges: the ADReSS and ADReSSo. The results show that both the proposed\nacoustic and linguistic systems can be better or comparable with previous\nresearch on the two datasets. Superior results are achieved by the proposed\nSwin-BERT system on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets, which are 85.58\\% F-score\nand 87.32\\% F-score respectively.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative condition where\nearly detection is vital. Handwriting, often affected early in AD, offers a\nnon-invasive and cost-effective way to capture subtle motor changes.\nState-of-the-art research on handwriting, mostly online, based AD detection has\npredominantly relied on manually extracted features, fed as input to shallow\nmachine learning models. Some recent works have proposed deep learning\n(DL)-based models, either 1D-CNN or 2D-CNN architectures, with performance\ncomparing favorably to handcrafted schemes. These approaches, however, overlook\nthe intrinsic relationship between the 2D spatial patterns of handwriting\nstrokes and their 1D dynamic characteristics, thus limiting their capacity to\ncapture the multimodal nature of handwriting data. Moreover, the application of\nTransformer models remains basically unexplored. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel approach for AD detection, consisting of a learnable\nmultimodal hybrid attention model that integrates simultaneously 2D handwriting\nimages with 1D dynamic handwriting signals. Our model leverages a gated\nmechanism to combine similarity and difference attention, blending the two\nmodalities and learning robust features by incorporating information at\ndifferent scales. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance on the DARWIN\ndataset, with an F1-score of 90.32\\% and accuracy of 90.91\\% in Task 8 ('L'\nwriting), surpassing the previous best by 4.61% and 6.06% respectively.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the\nleading cause of dementia, significantly impacting cost, mortality, and burden\nworldwide. The advent of high-throughput omics technologies, such as genomics,\ntranscriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics, has revolutionized the molecular\nunderstanding of AD. Conventional AI approaches typically require the\ncompletion of all omics data at the outset to achieve optimal AD diagnosis,\nwhich are inefficient and may be unnecessary. To reduce the clinical cost and\nimprove the accuracy of AD diagnosis using multi-omics data, we propose a novel\nstaged graph convolutional network with uncertainty quantification (SGUQ). SGUQ\nbegins with mRNA and progressively incorporates DNA methylation and miRNA data\nonly when necessary, reducing overall costs and exposure to harmful tests.\nExperimental results indicate that 46.23% of the samples can be reliably\npredicted using only single-modal omics data (mRNA), while an additional 16.04%\nof the samples can achieve reliable predictions when combining two omics data\ntypes (mRNA + DNA methylation). In addition, the proposed staged SGUQ achieved\nan accuracy of 0.858 on ROSMAP dataset, which outperformed existing methods\nsignificantly. The proposed SGUQ can not only be applied to AD diagnosis using\nmulti-omics data but also has the potential for clinical decision-making using\nmulti-viewed data.

        "summary": "Advances in deep learning (DL)-based models for brain image analysis have\nsignificantly enhanced the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis,\nallowing for more timely interventions. Despite these advancements, most\ncurrent DL models suffer from performance degradation when inferring on unseen\ndomain data owing to the variations in data distributions, a phenomenon known\nas domain shift. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called\nthe dynamic frequency mixup scheduler (DyMix) for unsupervised domain\nadaptation. Contrary to the conventional mixup technique, which involves simple\nlinear interpolations between predefined data points from the frequency space,\nour proposed DyMix dynamically adjusts the magnitude of the frequency regions\nbeing mixed from the source and target domains. Such an adaptive strategy\noptimizes the model's capacity to deal with domain variability, thereby\nenhancing its generalizability across the target domain. In addition, we\nincorporate additional strategies to further enforce the model's robustness\nagainst domain shifts, including leveraging amplitude-phase recombination to\nensure resilience to intensity variations and applying self-adversarial\nlearning to derive domain-invariant feature representations. Experimental\nresults on two benchmark datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validated\nthe effectiveness of our DyMix in that we demonstrated its outstanding\nperformance in AD diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "One of the major difficulties in machine learning methods is categorizing\ndatasets that are imbalanced. This problem may lead to biased models, where the\ntraining process is dominated by the majority class, resulting in inadequate\nrepresentation of the minority class. Universum twin support vector machine\n(UTSVM) produces a biased model towards the majority class, as a result, its\nperformance on the minority class is often poor as it might be mistakenly\nclassified as noise. Moreover, UTSVM is not proficient in handling datasets\nthat contain outliers and noises. Inspired by the concept of incorporating\nprior information about the data and employing an intuitionistic fuzzy\nmembership scheme, we propose intuitionistic fuzzy UTSVM for imbalanced data\n(IFUTSVM-ID) by enhancing overall robustness. We use an intuitionistic fuzzy\nmembership scheme to mitigate the impact of noise and outliers. Moreover, to\ntackle the problem of imbalanced class distribution, data oversampling and\nundersampling methods are utilized. Prior knowledge about the data is provided\nby universum data. This leads to better generalization performance. UTSVM is\nsusceptible to overfitting risks due to the omission of the structural risk\nminimization (SRM) principle in their primal formulations. However, the\nproposed IFUTSVM-ID model incorporates the SRM principle through the\nincorporation of regularization terms, effectively addressing the issue of\noverfitting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID\nmodel on benchmark datasets from KEEL and compare it with existing baseline\nmodels. Furthermore, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID\nmodel in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD), we applied them to the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental\nresults showcase the superiority of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID models compared to\nthe baseline models.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder\ncharacterized by the progressive accumulation of misfolded proteins, leading to\ncognitive decline. This study presents a novel stochastic modelling approach to\nsimulate the propagation of these proteins within the brain. We employ a\nnetwork diffusion model utilizing the Laplacian matrix derived from MRI data\nprovided by the Human Connectome Project (https://braingraph.org/cms/). The\ndeterministic model is extended by incorporating stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs) to account for inherent uncertainties in disease progression.\nIntroducing stochastic components into the model allows for a more realistic\nsimulation of the disease due to the multi-factorial nature of AD. By\nsimulation, the model captures the variability in misfolded protein\nconcentration across brain regions over time. Bayesian inference is a\nstatistical method that uses prior beliefs and given data to model a posterior\ndistribution for relevant parameter values. This allows us to better understand\nthe impact of noise and external factors on AD progression. Deterministic\nresults suggest that AD progresses at different speeds within each lobe of the\nbrain, moreover, the frontal takes the longest to reach a perfect disease\nstate. We find that in the presence of noise, the model never reaches a perfect\ndisease state and the later years of AD are more unpredictable than earlier on\nin the disease. These results highlight the importance of integrating\nstochastic elements into deterministic models to achieve more realistic\nsimulations, providing valuable insights for future studies on the dynamics of\nneurodegenerative diseases.",

This approach has two key advantages. First, it includes binary,\ndiscrete, and continuous variables. Second, it quantifies the uncertainty of\nthe estimates.

In this study, we design a GCGM to find the conditional\ndependencies and partial correlations among brain-region specific gray matter\nvolume and glucose uptake, amyloid-beta levels, demographic information, and\ncognitive test scores. We applied our model to 1022 participants, including\nhealthy and cognitively impaired, across different stages of AD. We found that\naging reduces cognition through three indirect pathways: hippocampal volume\nloss, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) volume loss, and amyloid-beta\naccumulation. We found a positive partial correlation between being woman and\ncognition, but also discovered four indirect pathways that dampen this\nassociation in women: lower hippocampal volume, lower PCC volume, more\namyloid-beta accumulation, and less education.

        "title": "Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Diseases and Dementia from MRI Images\n  Using an Ensemble Deep Learning",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that can\nresult in significant cognitive impairment and dementia. Accurate and timely\ndiagnosis is essential for effective treatment and management of this disease.\nIn this study, we proposed two low-parameter Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs), IR-BRAINNET and Modified-DEMNET, designed to detect the early stages of\nAD accurately. We also introduced an ensemble model that averages their outputs\nto reduce variance across the CNNs and enhance AD detection. Both CNNs are\ntrained, and all models are evaluated using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\ndataset from the Kaggle database. The dataset includes images of four stages of\ndementia, with an uneven class distribution. To mitigate challenges stemming\nfrom the inherent imbalance in the dataset, we employed the Synthetic Minority\nOver-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate additional instances for minority\nclasses. In the NO-SMOTE scenario, despite the imbalanced distribution, the\nensemble model achieved 98.28% accuracy, outperforming IR-BRAINNET (97.26%) and\nModified-DEMNET (95.54%), with Wilcoxon p-values of 2.9e-3 and 5.20e-6,\nrespectively, indicating significant improvement in correct predictions through\nthe use of the average function. In the SMOTE scenario, the ensemble model\nachieved 99.92% accuracy (1.64% improvement over NO-SMOTE), IR-BRAINNET reached\n99.80% (2.54% improvement), and Modified-DEMNET attained 99.72% (4.18%\nimprovement). Based on the experimental findings, averaging the models' outputs\nenhanced AD diagnosis in both scenarios, while the diversity in the dataset\nintroduced by SMOTE-generated instances significantly improved performance.\nFurthermore, the compact models we proposed outperformed those from previous\nstudies, even in the presence of an imbalanced distribution.",

        "title": "A Self-guided Multimodal Approach to Enhancing Graph Representation\n  Learning for Alzheimer's Diseases",
        "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning models designed to\nhandle irregularly structured data. However, their generic design often proves\ninadequate for analyzing brain connectomes in Alzheimer's Disease (AD),\nhighlighting the need to incorporate domain knowledge for optimal performance.\nInfusing AD-related knowledge into GNNs is a complicated task. Existing methods\ntypically rely on collaboration between computer scientists and domain experts,\nwhich can be both time-intensive and resource-demanding. To address these\nlimitations, this paper presents a novel self-guided, knowledge-infused\nmultimodal GNN that autonomously incorporates domain knowledge into the model\ndevelopment process. Our approach conceptualizes domain knowledge as natural\nlanguage and introduces a specialized multimodal GNN capable of leveraging this\nuncurated knowledge to guide the learning process of the GNN, such that it can\nimprove the model performance and strengthen the interpretability of the\npredictions. To evaluate our framework, we curated a comprehensive dataset of\nrecent peer-reviewed papers on AD and integrated it with multiple real-world AD\ndatasets. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our method to extract\nrelevant domain knowledge, provide graph-based explanations for AD diagnosis,\nand improve the overall performance of the GNN. This approach provides a more\nscalable and efficient alternative to inject domain knowledge for AD compared\nwith the manual design from the domain expert, advancing both prediction\naccuracy and interpretability in AD diagnosis.",

        "summary": "Compared to other clinical screening techniques, speech-and-language-based\nautomated Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection methods are characterized by their\nnon-invasiveness, cost-effectiveness, and convenience. Previous studies have\ndemonstrated the efficacy of fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) for\nAD detection. However, the objective of this traditional fine-tuning method,\nwhich involves inputting only transcripts, is inconsistent with the masked\nlanguage modeling (MLM) task used during the pre-training phase of PLMs. In\nthis paper, we investigate prompt-based fine-tuning of PLMs, converting the\nclassification task into a MLM task by inserting prompt templates into the\ntranscript inputs. We also explore the impact of incorporating pause\ninformation from forced alignment into manual transcripts. Additionally, we\ncompare the performance of various automatic speech recognition (ASR) models\nand select the Whisper model to generate ASR-based transcripts for comparison\nwith manual transcripts. Furthermore, majority voting and ensemble techniques\nare applied across different PLMs (BERT and RoBERTa) using different random\nseeds. Ultimately, we obtain maximum detection accuracy of 95.8% (with mean\n87.9%, std 3.3%) using manual transcripts, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance for AD detection using only transcripts on the ADReSS test set.",

        "summary": "Disease progression prediction based on patients' evolving health information\nis challenging when true disease states are unknown due to diagnostic\ncapabilities or high costs. For example, the absence of gold-standard\nneurological diagnoses hinders distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from\nrelated conditions such as AD-related dementias (ADRDs), including Lewy body\ndementia (LBD). Combining temporally dependent surrogate labels and health\nmarkers may improve disease prediction. However, existing literature models\ninformative surrogate labels and observed variables that reflect the underlying\nstates using purely generative approaches, limiting the ability to predict\nfuture states. We propose integrating the conventional hidden Markov model as a\ngenerative model with a time-varying discriminative classification model to\nsimultaneously handle potentially misspecified surrogate labels and incorporate\nimportant markers of disease progression. We develop an adaptive\nforward-backward algorithm with subjective labels for estimation, and utilize\nthe modified posterior and Viterbi algorithms to predict the progression of\nfuture states or new patients based on objective markers only. Importantly, the\nadaptation eliminates the need to model the marginal distribution of\nlongitudinal markers, a requirement in traditional algorithms. Asymptotic\nproperties are established, and significant improvement with finite samples is\ndemonstrated via simulation studies. Analysis of the neuropathological dataset\nof the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) shows much improved\naccuracy in distinguishing LBD from AD.",

In this study,\nthe contributions of T1-weighted (T1w) gray-white matter texture, volumetric\ninformation, and preprocessing -- particularly skull-stripping -- were\nsystematically assessed.\n  Methods: A dataset of 990 matched T1w MRIs from AD patients and cognitively\nnormal controls from the ADNI database were used. Preprocessing was varied\nthrough skull-stripping and intensity binarization to isolate texture and shape\ncontributions. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on each\nconfiguration, and classification performance was compared using exact McNemar\ntests with discrete Bonferroni-Holm correction. Feature relevance was analyzed\nusing Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, image similarity metrics, and spectral\nclustering of relevance maps.\n  Results: Despite substantial differences in image content, classification\naccuracy, sensitivity, and specificity remained stable across preprocessing\nconditions. Models trained on binarized images preserved performance,\nindicating minimal reliance on gray-white matter texture. Instead, volumetric\nfeatures -- particularly brain contours introduced through skull-stripping --\nwere consistently used by the models.\n  Conclusions: This behavior reflects a shortcut learning phenomenon, where\npreprocessing artifacts act as potentially unintended cues.

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial\nand temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture.\nSpecifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a\nsliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a\nspatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic\nspatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature\nrepresentation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature\nrepresentations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a\ncontrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states.\nExperimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD)\nprediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.",

However,\nexisting methods, whether based on manual feature extraction or deep learning,\nface two major challenges: the lack of large-scale datasets for robust feature\nlearning and evaluation, and poor detection performance due to inter-subject\nvariations. To address these challenges, we curate an EEG-AD corpus containing\n813 subjects, which forms the world's largest EEG-AD dataset to the best of our\nknowledge. Using this unique dataset, we propose LEAD, the first large\nfoundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Our method encompasses an entire\npipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to self-supervised contrastive\npretraining, fine-tuning, and key setups such as subject-independent evaluation\nand majority voting for subject-level detection. We pre-train the model on 11\nEEG datasets and unified fine-tune it on 5 AD datasets. Our self-supervised\npre-training design includes sample-level and subject-level contrasting to\nextract useful general EEG features. Fine-tuning is performed on 5\nchannel-aligned datasets together. The backbone encoder incorporates temporal\nand channel embeddings to capture features across both temporal and spatial\ndimensions. Our method demonstrates outstanding AD detection performance,\nachieving up to a 9.86% increase in F1 score at the sample-level and up to a\n9.31% at the subject-level compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Leveraging recent advancements\nin genomic foundation models, we present the innovative Reverse-Gene-Finder\ntechnology, a ground-breaking neuron-to-gene-token backtracking approach in a\nneural network architecture to elucidate the novel causal genetic biomarkers\ndriving AD onset. Reverse-Gene-Finder comprises three key innovations. Firstly,\nwe exploit the observation that genes with the highest probability of causing\nAD, defined as the most causal genes (MCGs), must have the highest probability\nof activating those neurons with the highest probability of causing AD, defined\nas the most causal neurons (MCNs). Secondly, we utilize a gene token\nrepresentation at the input layer to allow each gene (known or novel to AD) to\nbe represented as a discrete and unique entity in the input space. Lastly, in\ncontrast to the existing neural network architectures, which track neuron\nactivations from the input layer to the output layer in a feed-forward manner,\nwe develop an innovative backtracking method to track backwards from the MCNs\nto the input layer, identifying the Most Causal Tokens (MCTs) and the\ncorresponding MCGs. Reverse-Gene-Finder is highly interpretable, generalizable,\nand adaptable, providing a promising avenue for application in other disease\nscenarios.",

We present NeuroXVocal, a novel\ndual-component system that not only classifies but also explains potential AD\ncases through speech analysis.

These streams are\nfused through a custom transformer-based architecture that enables robust\ncross-modal interactions. The explainability component (XVocal) implements a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, leveraging Large Language Models\ncombined with a domain-specific knowledge base of AD research literature.

Using the IS2021\nADReSSo Challenge benchmark dataset, our system achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance with 95.77% accuracy in AD classification, significantly\noutperforming previous approaches.

Here, we performed quantitative\nproteomic mapping of C99 associated proteins in a Drosophila AD model and\nidentified three major functional modules nuclear gene expression,\nmitochondrial metabolism, and autophagy regulation frequently disrupted in AD.\nAmong these, several C99 interactors showed altered association upon treatment\nwith beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a metabolic ketone body with emerging\nneuroprotective properties. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that C99\nexpression induced severe mitochondrial fragmentation, cristae loss, and the\naccumulation of dense vesicles with fibrillar contents, indicative of impaired\norganelle integrity and degradative failure. These abnormalities were\nsubstantially reversed by BHB treatment, which restored mitochondrial\narchitecture, improved lysosomal acidification, and reduced the burden of\naberrant vesicles. Functional assays confirmed that BHB also rescued lifespan\nand memory deficits in C99-expressing flies. Further, expression of selected\nC99 interactors such as PPME1 and VPS35 was sufficient to ameliorate\nneurodegenerative phenotypes in vivo, underscoring their functional relevance.\nTogether, our findings define a multi-axis cellular pathology driven by C99\naccumulation and demonstrate that metabolic intervention via BHB can reprogram\ndisrupted proteomic networks and organelle homeostasis. These results establish\na mechanistic link between ketone signaling and early subcellular dysfunction\nin AD, offering potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "summary": "Simulating prospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from a given\nindividual brain image is challenging, as it requires accounting for canonical\nchanges in aging and/or disease progression while also considering the\nindividual brain's current status and unique characteristics. While current\ndeep generative models can produce high-resolution anatomically accurate\ntemplates for population-wide studies, their ability to predict future aging\ntrajectories for individuals remains limited, particularly in capturing\nsubject-specific neuroanatomical variations over time. In this study, we\nintroduce Individualized Brain Synthesis (InBrainSyn), a framework for\nsynthesizing high-resolution subject-specific longitudinal MRI scans that\nsimulate neurodegeneration in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal aging.\nInBrainSyn uses a parallel transport algorithm to adapt the population-level\naging trajectories learned by a generative deep template network, enabling\nindividualized aging synthesis. As InBrainSyn uses diffeomorphic\ntransformations to simulate aging, the synthesized images are topologically\nconsistent with the original anatomy by design. We evaluated InBrainSyn both\nquantitatively and qualitatively on AD and healthy control cohorts from the\nOpen Access Series of Imaging Studies - version 3 dataset. Experimentally,\nInBrainSyn can also model neuroanatomical transitions between normal aging and\nAD. An evaluation of an external set supports its generalizability. Overall,\nwith only a single baseline scan, InBrainSyn synthesizes realistic 3D\nspatiotemporal T1w MRI scans, producing personalized longitudinal aging\ntrajectories.

        "summary": "The causal relationships between biomarkers are essential for disease\ndiagnosis and medical treatment planning. One notable application is\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, where certain biomarkers may influence the\npresence of others, enabling early detection, precise disease staging, targeted\ntreatments, and improved monitoring of disease progression. However,\nunderstanding these causal relationships is complex and requires extensive\nresearch. Constructing a comprehensive causal network of biomarkers demands\nsignificant effort from human experts, who must analyze a vast number of\nresearch papers, and have bias in understanding diseases' biomarkers and their\nrelation. This raises an important question: Can advanced large language models\n(LLMs), such as those utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), assist in\nbuilding causal networks of biomarkers for further medical analysis? To explore\nthis, we collected 200 AD-related research papers published over the past 25\nyears and then integrated scientific literature with RAG to extract AD\nbiomarkers and generate causal relations among them. Given the high-risk nature\nof the medical diagnosis, we applied uncertainty estimation to assess the\nreliability of the generated causal edges and examined the faithfulness and\nscientificness of LLM reasoning using both automatic and human evaluation. We\nfind that RAG enhances the ability of LLMs to generate more accurate causal\nnetworks from scientific papers. However, the overall performance of LLMs in\nidentifying causal relations of AD biomarkers is still limited. We hope this\nstudy will inspire further foundational research on AI-driven analysis of AD\nbiomarkers causal network discovery.",

Existing deep learning\nmodels require large-scale annotated datasets and often function as \"black\nboxes\".

Here, we\nintroduce REMEMBER -- Retrieval-based Explainable Multimodal Evidence-guided\nModeling for Brain Evaluation and Reasoning -- a new machine learning framework\nthat facilitates zero- and few-shot Alzheimer's diagnosis using brain MRI scans\nthrough a reference-based reasoning process. Specifically, REMEMBER first\ntrains a contrastively aligned vision-text model using expert-annotated\nreference data and extends pseudo-text modalities that encode abnormality\ntypes, diagnosis labels, and composite clinical descriptions. Then, at\ninference time, REMEMBER retrieves similar, human-validated cases from a\ncurated dataset and integrates their contextual information through a dedicated\nevidence encoding module and attention-based inference head. Such an\nevidence-guided design enables REMEMBER to imitate real-world clinical\ndecision-making process by grounding predictions in retrieved imaging and\ntextual context. Specifically, REMEMBER outputs diagnostic predictions\nalongside an interpretable report, including reference images and explanations\naligned with clinical workflows.

        "summary": "The first step in evaluating a potential diagnostic biomarker is to examine\nthe variation in its values across different disease groups. In a three-class\ndisease setting, the volume under the receiver operating characteristic surface\nand the three-class Youden index are commonly used summary measures of a\nbiomarker's discriminatory ability. However, these measures rely on a\nstochastic ordering assumption for the distributions of biomarker outcomes\nacross the three groups. This assumption can be restrictive, particularly when\ncovariates are involved, and its violation may lead to incorrect conclusions\nabout a biomarker's ability to distinguish between the three disease classes.\nEven when a stochastic ordering exists, the order may vary across different\nbiomarkers in discovery studies involving dozens or even thousands of candidate\nbiomarkers, complicating automated ranking. To address these challenges and\ncomplement existing measures, we propose the underlap coefficient, a novel\nsummary index of a biomarker's ability to distinguish between three (or more)\ndisease groups, and study its properties. Additionally, we introduce Bayesian\nnonparametric estimators for both the unconditional underlap coefficient and\nits covariate-specific counterpart. These estimators are broadly applicable to\na wide range of biomarkers and populations. A simulation study reveals a good\nperformance of the proposed estimators across a range of conceivable scenarios.\nWe illustrate the proposed approach through an application to an Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD) dataset aimed to assess how four potential AD biomarkers\ndistinguish between individuals with normal cognition, mild impairment, and\ndementia, and how and if age and gender impact this discriminatory ability.",

This heterogeneity underscores the critical need\nfor predictive models capable of forecasting patient-specific disease\ntrajectories. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to address\nthis challenge by analyzing complex, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient\ndata. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI methodologies applied to\npersonalized AD progression prediction. We review key approaches including\nstate-space models for capturing temporal dynamics, deep learning techniques\nlike Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modeling, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) for leveraging network structures, and the emerging concept of AI-driven\ndigital twins for individualized simulation. Recognizing that data limitations\noften impede progress, we examine common challenges such as high\ndimensionality, missing data, and dataset imbalance. We further discuss\nAI-driven mitigation strategies, with a specific focus on synthetic data\ngeneration using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) to augment and balance datasets. The survey synthesizes the\nstrengths and limitations of current approaches, emphasizing the trend towards\nmultimodal integration and the persistent need for model interpretability and\ngeneralizability. Finally, we identify critical open challenges, including\nrobust external validation, clinical integration, and ethical considerations,\nand outline promising future research directions such as hybrid models, causal\ninference, and federated learning.

        "summary": "This work presents xEEGNet, a novel, compact, and explainable neural network\nfor EEG data analysis. It is fully interpretable and reduces overfitting\nthrough major parameter reduction. As an applicative use case, we focused on\nclassifying common dementia conditions, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal\ndementia, versus controls. xEEGNet is broadly applicable to other neurological\nconditions involving spectral alterations. We initially used ShallowNet, a\nsimple and popular model from the EEGNet-family. Its structure was analyzed and\ngradually modified to move from a \"black box\" to a more transparent model,\nwithout compromising performance. The learned kernels and weights were examined\nfrom a clinical standpoint to assess medical relevance. Model variants,\nincluding ShallowNet and the final xEEGNet, were evaluated using robust\nNested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation for unbiased performance\nestimates. Variability across data splits was explained using embedded EEG\nrepresentations, grouped by class and set, with pairwise separability to\nquantify group distinction. Overfitting was assessed through\ntraining-validation loss correlation and training speed. xEEGNet uses only 168\nparameters, 200 times fewer than ShallowNet, yet retains interpretability,\nresists overfitting, achieves comparable median performance (-1.5%), and\nreduces variability across splits. This variability is explained by embedded\nEEG representations: higher accuracy correlates with greater separation between\ntest set controls and Alzheimer's cases, without significant influence from\ntraining data. xEEGNet's ability to filter specific EEG bands, learn\nband-specific topographies, and use relevant spectral features demonstrates its\ninterpretability. While large deep learning models are often prioritized for\nperformance, this study shows smaller architectures like xEEGNet can be equally\neffective in EEG pathology classification.",

        "summary": "Multiple types or views of data (e.g. genetics, proteomics) measured on the\nsame set of individuals are now popularly generated in many biomedical studies.\nA particular interest might be the detection of sample subgroups (e.g. subtypes\nof disease) characterized by specific groups of variables. Biclustering methods\nare well-suited for this problem since they can group samples and variables\nsimultaneously. However, most existing biclustering methods cannot guarantee\nthat the detected sample clusters are clinically meaningful and related to a\nclinical outcome because they independently identify biclusters and associate\nsample clusters with a clinical outcome. Additionally, these methods have been\ndeveloped for continuous data when integrating data from different views and do\nnot allow for a mixture of data distributions. We propose a new formulation of\nbiclustering and prediction method for multi-view data from different\ndistributions that enhances our ability to identify clinically meaningful\nbiclusters by incorporating a clinical outcome. Sample clusters are defined\nbased on an adaptively chosen subset of variables and their association with a\nclinical outcome. We use extensive simulations to showcase the effectiveness of\nour proposed method in comparison to existing methods. Real-world applications\nusing lipidomics, imaging, and cognitive data on Alzheimer's disease(AD)\nidentified biclusters with significant cognitive differences that other methods\nmissed. The distinct lipid categories and brain regions characterizing the\nbiclusters suggest potential new insights into pathology of AD.",

        "summary": "The early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through widespread screening\nhas emerged as a primary strategy to mitigate the significant global impact of\nAD. EEG measurements offer a promising solution for extensive AD detection.\nHowever, the intricate and nonlinear dynamics of multichannel EEG signals pose\na considerable challenge for real-time AD diagnosis. This paper introduces a\nnovel algorithm, which is based on Quaternion Principal Component Analysis\n(QPCA) of multichannel EEG signals, for AD classification. The algorithm\nextracts high dimensional correlations among different channels to generate\nfeatures that are maximally representative with minimal information redundancy.\nThis provides a multidimensional and precise measure of brain connectivity in\ndisease assessment. Simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance\nand to identify the most critical EEG channels or brain regions for AD\nclassification. The results reveal a significant drop of connectivity measure\nin the alpha bands. The average AD classification accuracy for all 4-channel\ncombinations reached 95%, while some particular permutations of channels\nachieved 100% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the temporal lobe emerges as one of\nthe most important regions in AD classification given that the EEG signals are\nrecorded during the presentation of an auditory stimulant. The selection of key\nparameters of the QPCA algorithm have been evaluated and some recommendations\nare proposed for further performance enhancement. This paper marks the first\napplication of the QPCA algorithm for AD classification and brain connectivity\nanalysis using multichannel EEG signals.",

While traditional multimodal analysis requires matched\npatient IDs across datasets, our approach demonstrates population-level\nintegration of MRI, gene expression, biomarkers, EEG, and clinical indicators\nfrom independent cohorts. Statistical analysis identified significant features\nin each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then\nanalyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in\nnatural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including\na potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities\nvia neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between\nfrontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58,\np<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of\nmajor findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%).\nThe reproducibility of these findings was further supported by expert review\n(Cohen's k=0.82) and computational validation.

Biases\nassociated with age, race, and gender in a multi-cohort dataset, as well as the\ninfluence of proxy features encoding these sensitive attributes, are\ninvestigated. The reliability of various fairness definitions and metrics in\nthe identification of such biases is also assessed. Based on the most\nappropriate fairness measures, a comparative analysis of widely used\npre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation strategies\nis performed. Moreover, a novel composite measure is introduced to quantify the\ntrade-off between fairness and performance by considering the F1-score and the\nequalized odds ratio, making it appropriate for medical diagnostic\napplications. The obtained results reveal the existence of biases related to\nage and race, while no significant gender bias is observed. The deployed\nmitigation strategies yield varying improvements in terms of fairness across\nthe different sensitive attributes and studied subproblems. For race and\ngender, Reject Option Classification improves equalized odds by 46% and 57%,\nrespectively, and achieves harmonic mean scores of 0.75 and 0.80 in the MCI\nversus AD subproblem, whereas for age, in the same subproblem, adversarial\ndebiasing yields the highest equalized odds improvement of 40% with a harmonic\nmean score of 0.69.

        "summary": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive\nimpairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the\nhigh cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods\noffer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational\ndemands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained\nsettings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are\ninherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural\ndegeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and\nlow-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak\nexpressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in\ncomplex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a\nhybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons\nwith region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design\nenables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic\naccuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves\ncompetitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability,\nsupporting its potential for practical AD screening.

In the\nresearch field of deep learning-assisted diagnosis of AD, traditional\nconvolutional neural networks and simple feature concatenation methods fail to\neffectively utilize the complementary information between multimodal data, and\nthe simple feature concatenation approach is prone to cause the loss of key\ninformation during the process of modal fusion. In recent years, the\ndevelopment of deep learning technology has brought new possibilities for\nsolving the problem of how to effectively fuse multimodal features. This paper\nproposes a novel deep learning algorithm framework to assist medical\nprofessionals in AD diagnosis. By fusing medical multi-view information such as\nbrain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), genetic data, and clinical data, it can accurately detect the\npresence of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN).\nThe innovation of the algorithm lies in the use of an asymmetric cross-modal\ncross-attention mechanism, which can effectively capture the key information\nfeatures of the interactions between different data modal features. This paper\ncompares the asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism with the\ntraditional algorithm frameworks of unimodal and multimodal deep learning\nmodels for AD diagnosis, and evaluates the importance of the asymmetric\ncross-modal cross-attention mechanism.

        "summary": "Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in\nsystems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric\nLeave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify\ncooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order\neffects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.\nDifferently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score\nmeasures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by\nthree scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and\nsynergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores\n(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data\nset, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named\n{\\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we\nfocus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and\nAlzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic\nassociation between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,\nespecially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of\nurban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the\nprediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool\nof wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to\nanalyze high-order relationships in complex systems.",

        "summary": "Functional MRI is a neuroimaging technique aiming at analyzing the functional\nactivity of the brain by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals\nthroughout the brain. The derived functional features can be used for\ninvestigating brain alterations in neurological and psychiatric disorders. In\nthis work, we employed the hypergraph structure to model high-order functional\nrelations across brain regions, introducing algebraic connectivity (a(G)) for\nestimating the hyperedge weights. The hypergraph structure was derived from\nhealthy controls to build a common topological structure across individuals.\nThe considered cohort included subjects covering the Alzheimer's disease (AD)\ncontinuum, that is both mild cognitive impairment and AD patients. Statistical\nanalysis was performed using the hyperedges' weights as features to assess the\ndifferences across the three groups. Additionally, a mediation analysis was\nperformed to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of the a(G) values,\nrepresenting the functional information, as the mediator between tau-PET\nlevels, a key biomarker of AD, and cognitive scores. The proposed approach\noutperformed state-of-the-art methods in identifying a larger number of\nhyperedges statistically different across groups. Among these, two hyperedges\nbelonging to salience ventral attention and somatomotor networks showed a\npartial mediation effect between the tau biomarkers and cognitive decline.\nThese results suggested that the a(G) can be an effective approach for\nextracting the hyperedge weights, including important functional information\nthat resides in the brain areas forming the hyperedges.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression follows a complex continuum from normal\ncognition (NC) through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, yet most\ndeep learning approaches oversimplify this into discrete classification tasks.\nThis study introduces M$^3$AD, a novel multi-task multi-gate mixture of experts\nframework that jointly addresses diagnostic classification and cognitive\ntransition modeling using structural MRI. We incorporate three key innovations:\n(1) an open-source T1-weighted sMRI preprocessing pipeline, (2) a unified\nlearning framework capturing NC-MCI-AD transition patterns with demographic\npriors (age, gender, brain volume) for improved generalization, and (3) a\ncustomized multi-gate mixture of experts architecture enabling effective\nmulti-task learning with structural MRI alone. The framework employs\nspecialized expert networks for diagnosis-specific pathological patterns while\nshared experts model common structural features across the cognitive continuum.\nA two-stage training protocol combines SimMIM pretraining with multi-task\nfine-tuning for joint optimization. Comprehensive evaluation across six\ndatasets comprising 12,037 T1-weighted sMRI scans demonstrates superior\nperformance: 95.13% accuracy for three-class NC-MCI-AD classification and\n99.15% for binary NC-AD classification, representing improvements of 4.69% and\n0.55% over state-of-the-art approaches. The multi-task formulation\nsimultaneously achieves 97.76% accuracy in predicting cognitive transition.

        "title": "An Interpretable Multi-Plane Fusion Framework With Kolmogorov-Arnold\n  Network Guided Attention Enhancement for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that\nseverely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in\nAD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due\nto the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep\nlearning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear\nrelationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their\nability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane\nfusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial\nplanes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention\nmechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy\nfeatures. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction\nfrom multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural\ninformation. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible\nand accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise\nidentification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments\non the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior\nperformance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of\nright-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD\nprogression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.",

        "summary": "Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable\nopportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective\nand timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained\nsignificant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:\nhow to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based\nreports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework\nthat aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal\nlatent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing\nrepresentation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat\nbrain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to\nalign with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient\nidentification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and\nclinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest\nas network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We\napplied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.\nOur approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also\nidentifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights\ninto the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development\nof clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.",

        "summary": "Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD),\nmultiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge\ndeterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and\nneuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting\npredictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that\ntransforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and\nLaplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and\nemploys quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum\neigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct\nserves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis\nof neurodegenerative diseases. We extend this to quaternionic representations\nwith three imaginary axes ($i, j, k$) to model multistate Hamiltonians in\nmultifaceted disorders, drawing from quantum neuromorphic computing to capture\nentangled neural dynamics \\citep{Pehle2020, Emani2019}. This approach leverages\nquantum advantages in handling high-dimensional amplitude-phase data, enabling\noutlier detection and frequency signature analysis.

Challenge participants were\nrequired to make a prediction, for each month of a 5-year future time period,\nof three key outcomes: clinical diagnosis, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale\nCognitive Subdomain (ADAS-Cog13), and total volume of the ventricles. The\nmethods used by challenge participants included multivariate linear regression,\nmachine learning methods such as support vector machines and deep neural\nnetworks, as well as disease progression models. No single submission was best\nat predicting all three outcomes. For clinical diagnosis and ventricle volume\nprediction, the best algorithms strongly outperform simple baselines in\npredictive ability. However, for ADAS-Cog13 no single submitted prediction\nmethod was significantly better than random guesswork. Two ensemble methods\nbased on taking the mean and median over all predictions, obtained top scores\non almost all tasks. Better than average performance at diagnosis prediction\nwas generally associated with the additional inclusion of features from\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). On the\nother hand, better performance at ventricle volume prediction was associated\nwith inclusion of summary statistics, such as the slope or maxima/minima of\nbiomarkers. TADPOLE's unique results suggest that current prediction algorithms\nprovide sufficient accuracy to exploit biomarkers related to clinical diagnosis\nand ventricle volume, for cohort refinement in clinical trials for Alzheimer's\ndisease.

        "summary": "In this article, we analyze the morphometry of hippocampus in subjects with\nvery mild dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and nondemented controls and how\nit changes over a two-year period. Morphometric differences with respect to a\ntemplate hippocampus were measured by the metric distance obtained from the\nLarge Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) algorithm which was\npreviously used to calculate dense one-to-one correspondence vector fields\nbetween the shapes. LDDMM assigns metric distances on the space of anatomical\nimages thereby allowing for the direct comparison and quantization of\nmorphometric changes. We use various statistical methods to compare the metric\ndistances in a cross-sectional and longitudinal manner. At baseline, the metric\ndistances for demented subjects are found not to be significantly different\nfrom those for nondemented subjects. At follow-up, the metric distances for\ndemented subjects were significantly larger compared to nondemented subjects.\nThe metric distances for demented subjects increased significantly from\nbaseline to follow-up but not for nondemented subjects. We also use the metric\ndistances in logistic regression for diagnostic discrimination of subjects. We\ncompare metric distances with the volumes and obtain similar results. In\nclassification, the model that uses volume, metric distance, and volume loss\nover time together performs better in detecting DAT. Thus, metric distances\nwith respect to a template computed via LDDMM can be a powerful tool in\ndetecting differences in shape in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal\nstudies.",

        "summary": "A typical problem in causal modeling is the instability of model structure\nlearning, i.e., small changes in finite data can result in completely different\noptimal models. The present work introduces a novel causal modeling algorithm\nfor longitudinal data, that is robust for finite samples based on recent\nadvances in stability selection using subsampling and selection algorithms. Our\napproach uses exploratory search but allows incorporation of prior knowledge,\ne.g., the absence of a particular causal relationship between two specific\nvariables. We represent causal relationships using structural equation models.\nModels are scored along two objectives: the model fit and the model complexity.\nSince both objectives are often conflicting we apply a multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithm to search for Pareto optimal models. To handle the\ninstability of small finite data samples, we repeatedly subsample the data and\nselect those substructures (from the optimal models) that are both stable and\nparsimonious. These substructures can be visualized through a causal graph. Our\nmore exploratory approach achieves at least comparable performance as, but\noften a significant improvement over state-of-the-art alternative approaches on\na simulated data set with a known ground truth. We also present the results of\nour method on three real-world longitudinal data sets on chronic fatigue\nsyndrome, Alzheimer disease, and chronic kidney disease. The findings obtained\nwith our approach are generally in line with results from more\nhypothesis-driven analyses in earlier studies and suggest some novel\nrelationships that deserve further research.",

        "summary": "We used redescription mining to find interpretable rules revealing\nassociations between those determinants that provide insights about the\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). We extended the CLUS-RM redescription mining\nalgorithm to a constraint-based redescription mining (CBRM) setting, which\nenables several modes of targeted exploration of specific, user-constrained\nassociations. Redescription mining enabled finding specific constructs of\nclinical and biological attributes that describe many groups of subjects of\ndifferent size, homogeneity and levels of cognitive impairment. We confirmed\nsome previously known findings. However, in some instances, as with the\nattributes: testosterone, the imaging attribute Spatial Pattern of\nAbnormalities for Recognition of Early AD, as well as the levels of leptin and\nangiopoietin-2 in plasma, we corroborated previously debatable findings or\nprovided additional information about these variables and their association\nwith AD pathogenesis. Applying redescription mining on ADNI data resulted with\nthe discovery of one largely unknown attribute: the Pregnancy-Associated\nProtein-A (PAPP-A), which we found highly associated with cognitive impairment\nin AD. Statistically significant correlations (p <= 0.01) were found between\nPAPP-A and various different clinical tests. The high importance of this\nfinding lies in the fact that PAPP-A is a metalloproteinase, known to cleave\ninsulin-like growth factor binding proteins. Since it also shares similar\nsubstrates with A Disintegrin and the Metalloproteinase family of enzymes that\nact as {\\alpha}-secretase to physiologically cleave amyloid precursor protein\n(APP) in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, it could be directly involved in the\nmetabolism of APP very early during the disease course. Therefore, further\nstudies should investigate the role of PAPP-A in the development of AD more\nthoroughly.",

        "summary": "In the first part of this paper we review a mathematical model for the onset\nand progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that was developed in subsequent\nsteps over several years. The model is meant to describe the evolution of AD in\nvivo. In [Y. Achdou et al., 2013] we treated the problem at a microscopic\nscale, where the typical length scale is a multiple of the size of the soma of\na single neuron. Subsequently, in [M. Bertsch at al., 2016] we concentrated on\nthe macroscopic scale, where brain neurons are regarded as a continuous medium,\nstructured by their degree of malfunctioning.\n  In the second part of the paper we consider the relation between the\nmicroscopic and the macroscopic models. In particular we show under which\nassumptions the kinetic transport equation, which in the macroscopic model\ngoverns the evolution of the probability measure for the degree of\nmalfunctioning of neurons, can be derived from a particle-based setting.\n  In the microscopic model we consider basically mechanism i), modelling it by\na system of Smoluchowski equations for the amyloid concentration (describing\nthe agglomeration phenomenon), with the addition of a diffusion term as well as\nof a source term on the neuronal membrane. At the macroscopic level instead we\nmodel processes i) and ii) by a system of Smoluchowski equations for the\namyloid concentration, coupled to a kinetic-type transport equation for the\ndistribution function of the degree of malfunctioning of the neurons. The\nsecond equation contains an integral term describing the random onset of the\ndisease as a jump process localized in particularly sensitive areas of the\nbrain.\n  Even though we deliberately neglected many aspects of the complexity of the\nbrain and the disease, numerical simulations are in both cases (microscopic and\nmacroscopic) in good qualitative agreement with clinical data.",

        "title": "Disease Prediction using Graph Convolutional Networks: Application to\n  Autism Spectrum Disorder and Alzheimer's Disease",
        "summary": "Graphs are widely used as a natural framework that captures interactions\nbetween individual elements represented as nodes in a graph. In medical\napplications, specifically, nodes can represent individuals within a\npotentially large population (patients or healthy controls) accompanied by a\nset of features, while the graph edges incorporate associations between\nsubjects in an intuitive manner. This representation allows to incorporate the\nwealth of imaging and non-imaging information as well as individual subject\nfeatures simultaneously in disease classification tasks. Previous graph-based\napproaches for supervised or unsupervised learning in the context of disease\nprediction solely focus on pairwise similarities between subjects, disregarding\nindividual characteristics and features, or rather rely on subject-specific\nimaging feature vectors and fail to model interactions between them. In this\npaper, we present a thorough evaluation of a generic framework that leverages\nboth imaging and non-imaging information and can be used for brain analysis in\nlarge populations. This framework exploits Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\nand involves representing populations as a sparse graph, where its nodes are\nassociated with imaging-based feature vectors, while phenotypic information is\nintegrated as edge weights. The extensive evaluation explores the effect of\neach individual component of this framework on disease prediction performance\nand further compares it to different baselines. The framework performance is\ntested on two large datasets with diverse underlying data, ABIDE and ADNI, for\nthe prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder and conversion to Alzheimer's\ndisease, respectively. Our analysis shows that our novel framework can improve\nover state-of-the-art results on both databases, with 70.4% classification\naccuracy for ABIDE and 80.0% for ADNI.",

        "title": "Training recurrent neural networks robust to incomplete data:\n  application to Alzheimer's disease progression modeling",
        "summary": "Disease progression modeling (DPM) using longitudinal data is a challenging\nmachine learning task. Existing DPM algorithms neglect temporal dependencies\namong measurements, make parametric assumptions about biomarker trajectories,\ndo not model multiple biomarkers jointly, and need an alignment of subjects'\ntrajectories. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to\naddress these issues. However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain\nincomplete data, which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires a\npre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead, we\npropose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN architecture,\nlong short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle both missing predictor\nand target values. The proposed LSTM algorithm is applied to model the\nprogression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using six volumetric magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) biomarkers, i.e., volumes of ventricles, hippocampus, whole\nbrain, fusiform, middle temporal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex, and it is\ncompared to standard LSTM networks with data imputation and a parametric,\nregression-based DPM method. The results show that the proposed algorithm\nachieves a significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the alternatives\nwith p < 0.05 using Wilcoxon signed rank test in predicting values of almost\nall of the MRI biomarkers. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)\nclassifier applied to the predicted biomarker values produces a significantly\nlarger AUC of 0.90 vs. at most 0.84 with p < 0.001 using McNemar's test for\nclinical diagnosis of AD. Inspection of MAE curves as a function of the amount\nof missing data reveals that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves the best\nperformance up until more than 74% missing values. Finally, it is illustrated\nhow the method can successfully be applied to data with varying time intervals.",

        "title": "Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation for Explaining Deep Neural Network\n  Decisions in MRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Classification",
        "summary": "Deep neural networks have led to state-of-the-art results in many medical\nimaging tasks including Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection based on structural\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, the network decisions are often\nperceived as being highly non-transparent, making it difficult to apply these\nalgorithms in clinical routine. In this study, we propose using layer-wise\nrelevance propagation (LRP) to visualize convolutional neural network decisions\nfor AD based on MRI data. Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP\nproduces a heatmap in the input space indicating the importance/relevance of\neach voxel contributing to the final classification outcome. In contrast to\nsusceptibility maps produced by guided backpropagation (\"Which change in voxels\nwould change the outcome most?\"), the LRP method is able to directly highlight\npositive contributions to the network classification in the input space. In\nparticular, we show that (1) the LRP method is very specific for individuals\n(\"Why does this person have AD?\") with high inter-patient variability, (2)\nthere is very little relevance for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that\nexhibit a lot of relevance correlate well with what is known from literature.\nTo quantify the latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed\nrelevance per brain area, e.g., relevance density or relevance gain. Although\nthese metrics produce very individual \"fingerprints\" of relevance patterns for\nAD patients, a lot of importance is put on areas in the temporal lobe including\nthe hippocampus. After discussing several limitations such as sensitivity\ntoward the underlying model and computation parameters, we conclude that LRP\nmight have a high potential to assist clinicians in explaining neural network\ndecisions for diagnosing AD (and potentially other diseases) based on\nstructural MRI data.",

        "summary": "Deep learning has shown outstanding performance in identifying intricate\nstructures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of\ncomputer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and\nautomated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained\nconsiderable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has\ngenerated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of\npublications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for\ndiagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar\nsearch was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between\nJanuary 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and\nclassified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were\nsummarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination\nof deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only\ndeep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for\nclassification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced\naccuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of\nconversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to\nAD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or\nrecurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without\npreprocessing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for\nAD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best\nclassification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid\nbiomarkers were combined. AD research that uses deep learning is still\nevolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types,\nincreasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of\nspecific disease-related features and mechanisms.",

        "summary": "The use of neural networks for diagnosis classification is becoming more and\nmore prevalent in the medical imaging community. However, deep learning method\noutputs remain hard to explain. Another difficulty is to choose among the large\nnumber of techniques developed to analyze how networks learn, as all present\ndifferent limitations. In this paper, we extended the framework of Fong and\nVedaldi [IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017] to\nvisualize the training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on 3D\nquantitative neuroimaging data. Our application focuses on the detection of\nAlzheimer's disease with gray matter probability maps extracted from structural\nMRI. We first assessed the robustness of the visualization method by studying\nthe coherence of the longitudinal patterns and regions identified by the\nnetwork. We then studied the stability of the CNN training by computing\nvisualization-based similarity indexes between different re-runs of the CNN. We\ndemonstrated that the areas identified by the CNN were consistent with what is\nknown of Alzheimer's disease and that the visualization approach extract\ncoherent longitudinal patterns. We also showed that the CNN training is not\nstable and that the areas identified mainly depend on the initialization and\nthe training process. This issue may exist in many other medical studies using\ndeep learning methods on datasets in which the number of samples is too small\nand the data dimension is high. This means that it may not be possible to rely\non deep learning to detect stable regions of interest in this field yet.",

        "summary": "Current neuroimaging techniques provide paths to investigate the structure\nand function of the brain in vivo and have made great advances in understanding\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). However, the group-level analyses prevalently used\nfor investigation and understanding of the disease are not applicable for\ndiagnosis of individuals. More recently, deep learning, which can efficiently\nanalyze large-scale complex patterns in 3D brain images, has helped pave the\nway for computer-aided individual diagnosis by providing accurate and automated\ndisease classification. Great progress has been made in classifying AD with\ndeep learning models developed upon increasingly available structural MRI data.\nThe lack of scale-matched functional neuroimaging data prevents such models\nfrom being further improved by observing functional changes in pathophysiology.\nHere we propose a potential solution by first learning a\nstructural-to-functional transformation in brain MRI, and further synthesizing\nspatially matched functional images from large-scale structural scans. We\nevaluated our approach by building computational models to discriminate\npatients with AD from healthy normal subjects and demonstrated a performance\nboost after combining the structural and synthesized functional brain images\ninto the same model. Furthermore, our regional analyses identified the temporal\nlobe to be the most predictive structural-region and the parieto-occipital lobe\nto be the most predictive functional-region of our model, which are both in\nconcordance with previous group-level neuroimaging findings. Together, we\ndemonstrate the potential of deep learning with large-scale structural and\nsynthesized functional MRI to impact AD classification and to identify AD's\nneuroimaging signatures.",

We also outline the OVBM design\nmethodology leading us to such architecture, which in general can incorporate\nmultimodal biomarkers and target simultaneously several diseases and other AI\ntasks. Key in our methodology is the use of multiple biomarkers complementing\neach other, and when two of them uniquely identify different subjects in a\ntarget disease we say they are orthogonal. We illustrate the methodology by\nintroducing 16 biomarkers, three of which are orthogonal, demonstrating\nsimultaneous above state-of-the-art discrimination for apparently unrelated\ndiseases such as AD and COVID-19. Inspired by research conducted at the MIT\nCenter for Brain Minds and Machines, OVBM combines biomarker implementations of\nthe four modules of intelligence: The brain OS chunks and overlaps audio\nsamples and aggregates biomarker features from the sensory stream and cognitive\ncore creating a multi-modal graph neural network of symbolic compositional\nmodels for the target task. We apply it to AD, achieving above state-of-the-art\naccuracy of 93.8% on raw audio, while extracting a subject saliency map that\nlongitudinally tracks relative disease progression using multiple biomarkers,\n16 in the reported AD task. The ultimate aim is to help medical practice by\ndetecting onset and treatment impact so that intervention options can be\nlongitudinally tested. Using the OBVM design methodology, we introduce a novel\nlung and respiratory tract biomarker created using 200,000+ cough samples to\npre-train a model discriminating cough cultural origin.

        "summary": "In recent years, the number of papers on Alzheimer's disease classification\nhas increased dramatically, generating interesting methodological ideas on the\nuse machine learning and feature extraction methods. However, practical impact\nis much more limited and, eventually, one could not tell which of these\napproaches are the most efficient. While over 90\\% of these works make use of\nADNI an objective comparison between approaches is impossible due to variations\nin the subjects included, image pre-processing, performance metrics and\ncross-validation procedures. In this paper, we propose a framework for\nreproducible classification experiments using multimodal MRI and PET data from\nADNI. The core components are: 1) code to automatically convert the full ADNI\ndatabase into BIDS format; 2) a modular architecture based on Nipype in order\nto easily plug-in different classification and feature extraction tools; 3)\nfeature extraction pipelines for MRI and PET data; 4) baseline classification\napproaches for unimodal and multimodal features. This provides a flexible\nframework for benchmarking different feature extraction and classification\ntools in a reproducible manner. We demonstrate its use on all (1519) baseline\nT1 MR images and all (1102) baseline FDG PET images from ADNI 1, GO and 2 with\nSPM-based feature extraction pipelines and three different classification\ntechniques (linear SVM, anatomically regularized SVM and multiple kernel\nlearning SVM).

From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8%\nof tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity.\nThe strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and\nobesity. Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity, and diet and\nobesity DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO\ntopics.

The performance of\nthe different approaches is also difficult to compare objectively. In\nparticular, it is often difficult to assess which part of the method provides a\nreal improvement, if any. We propose a framework for reproducible and objective\nclassification experiments in AD using three publicly available datasets (ADNI,\nAIBL and OASIS). The framework comprises: i) automatic conversion of the three\ndatasets into BIDS format, ii) a modular set of preprocessing pipelines,\nfeature extraction and classification methods, together with an evaluation\nframework, that provide a baseline for benchmarking the different components.\nWe demonstrate the use of the framework for a large-scale evaluation on 1960\nparticipants using T1 MRI and FDG PET data. In this evaluation, we assess the\ninfluence of different modalities, preprocessing, feature types, classifiers,\ntraining set sizes and datasets. Performances were in line with the\nstate-of-the-art. FDG PET outperformed T1 MRI for all classification tasks.

        "summary": "We introduce Disease Knowledge Transfer (DKT), a novel technique for\ntransferring biomarker information between related neurodegenerative diseases.\nDKT infers robust multimodal biomarker trajectories in rare neurodegenerative\ndiseases even when only limited, unimodal data is available, by transferring\ninformation from larger multimodal datasets from common neurodegenerative\ndiseases. DKT is a joint-disease generative model of biomarker progressions,\nwhich exploits biomarker relationships that are shared across diseases. Our\nproposed method allows, for the first time, the estimation of plausible,\nmultimodal biomarker trajectories in Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a rare\nneurodegenerative disease where only unimodal MRI data is available. For this\nwe train DKT on a combined dataset containing subjects with two distinct\ndiseases and sizes of data available: 1) a larger, multimodal typical AD (tAD)\ndataset from the TADPOLE Challenge, and 2) a smaller unimodal Posterior\nCortical Atrophy (PCA) dataset from the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), for\nwhich only a limited number of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are\navailable. Although validation is challenging due to lack of data in PCA, we\nvalidate DKT on synthetic data and two patient datasets (TADPOLE and PCA\ncohorts), showing it can estimate the ground truth parameters in the simulation\nand predict unseen biomarkers on the two patient datasets. While we\ndemonstrated DKT on Alzheimer's variants, we note DKT is generalisable to other\nforms of related neurodegenerative diseases.

        "summary": "Background: Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system\ndisease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder, an\nincreasing number of genetic epidemiological studies show clear link between AD\nand T2DM. The current approach to uncovering the shared pathways between AD and\nT2DM involves association analysis; however, such analyses lack power to\ndiscover the mechanisms of the diseases. Methods: We develop novel statistical\nmethods to shift the current paradigm of genetic analysis from association\nanalysis to deep causal inference for uncovering the shared mechanisms between\nAD and T2DM, and develop pipelines to infer multilevel omics causal networks\nwhich lead to shifting the current paradigm of genetic analysis from genetic\nanalysis alone to integrated causal genomic, epigenomic, transcriptional and\nphenotypic data analysis. To discover common causal paths from genetic variants\nto AD and T2DM, we also develop algorithms that can automatically search the\ncausal paths from genetic variants to diseases and Results: The proposed\nmethods and algorithms are applied to ROSMAP dataset with 432 individuals who\nsimultaneously had genotype, RNA-seq, DNA methylation and some phenotypes. We\nconstruct multi-omics causal networks and identify 13 shared causal genes, 16\nshared causal pathways between AD and T2DM, and 754 gene expression and 101\ngene methylation nodes that were connected to both AD and T2DM in multi-omics\ncausal networks. Conclusions: The results of application of the proposed\npipelines for identifying causal paths to real data analysis of AD and T2DM\nprovided strong evidence to support the link between AD and T2DM and unraveled\ncausal mechanism to explain this link.",

In the former case we implement a\nparametric bootstrap for testing SNP coefficients and make comparisons with\np-values obtained from the chi-squared null distribution.

        "summary": "We show that simple, commercially sourced n-channel silicon field-effect\ntransistors (nFETs) operating under closed loop control exhibit an ~3-fold\nimprovement in pH readout resolution to (7.2+/-0.3)x10^-3 at a bandwidth of 10\nHz when compared with the open loop operation commonly employed by integrated\nion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs). We leveraged the improved nFET\nperformance to measure the change in solution pH arising from the activity of a\npathological form of the kinase Cdk5, an enzyme implicated in Alzheimer's\ndisease, and showed quantitative agreement with previous measurements. The\nimproved pH resolution was realized while the devices were operated in a remote\nsensing configuration with the pH sensing element off-chip and connected\nelectrically to the FET gate terminal. We compared these results with those\nmeasured by using a custom-built dual-gate 2D field-effect transistor (dg2DFET)\nfabricated with 2D semi-conducting MoS2 channels and a moderate device gain,\nalpha=8. Under identical solution conditions the pH resolution of the nFETs was\nonly 2-fold worse than the dg2DFETs pH resolution of (3.9+/-0.7)x10^-3.\nFinally, using the nFETs, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a custom\npolypeptide, p5, as a therapeutic agent in restoring the function of Cdk5. We\nexpect that the straight-forward modifications to commercially sourced nFETs\ndemonstrated here will lower the barrier to widespread adoption of these\nremote-gate devices and enable sensitive bioanalytical measurements for high\nthroughput screening in drug discovery and precision medicine applications.",

        "title": "QC-SPHRAM: Quasi-conformal Spherical Harmonics Based Geometric\n  Distortions on Hippocampal Surfaces for Early Detection of the Alzheimer's\n  Disease",
        "summary": "We propose a disease classification model, called the QC-SPHARM, for the\nearly detection of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The proposed QC-SPHARM can\ndistinguish between normal control (NC) subjects and AD patients, as well as\nbetween amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients having high\npossibility progressing into AD and those who do not. Using the spherical\nharmonics (SPHARM) based registration, hippocampal surfaces segmented from the\nADNI data are individually registered to a template surface constructed from\nthe NC subjects using SPHARM. Local geometric distortions of the deformation\nfrom the template surface to each subject are quantified in terms of\nconformality distortions and curvatures distortions. The measurements are\ncombined with the spherical harmonics coefficients and the total volume change\nof the subject from the template. Afterwards, a t-test based feature selection\nmethod incorporating the bagging strategy is applied to extract those local\nregions having high discriminating power of the two classes. The disease\ndiagnosis machine can therefore be built using the data under the Support\nVector Machine (SVM) setting. Using 110 NC subjects and 110 AD patients from\nthe ADNI database, the proposed algorithm achieves 85:2% testing accuracy on 80\nrandom samples as testing subjects, with the incorporation of surface geometry\nin the classification machine. Using 20 aMCI patients who has advanced to AD\nduring a two-year period and another 20 aMCI patients who remain non-AD for the\nnext two years, the algorithm achieves 81:2% accuracy using 10 randomly picked\nsubjects as testing data. Our proposed method is 6%-15% better than other\nclassification models without the incorporation of surface geometry. The\nresults demonstrate the advantages of using local geometric distortions as the\ndiscriminating criterion for early AD diagnosis.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as one of the major causes of dementia and\nis characterized by slow progression over several years, with no treatments or\navailable medicines. In this regard, there have been efforts to identify the\nrisk of developing AD in its earliest time. While many of the previous works\nconsidered cross-sectional analysis, more recent studies have focused on the\ndiagnosis and prognosis of AD with longitudinal or time series data in a way of\ndisease progression modeling (DPM). Under the same problem settings, in this\nwork, we propose a novel computational framework that can predict the\nphenotypic measurements of MRI biomarkers and trajectories of clinical status\nalong with cognitive scores at multiple future time points. However, in\nhandling time series data, it generally faces with many unexpected missing\nobservations. In regard to such an unfavorable situation, we define a secondary\nproblem of estimating those missing values and tackle it in a systematic way by\ntaking account of temporal and multivariate relations inherent in time series\ndata. Concretely, we propose a deep recurrent network that jointly tackles the\nfour problems of (i) missing value imputation, (ii) phenotypic measurements\nforecasting, (iii) trajectory estimation of the cognitive score, and (iv)\nclinical status prediction of a subject based on his/her longitudinal imaging\nbiomarkers. Notably, the learnable model parameters of our network are trained\nin an end-to-end manner with our circumspectly defined loss function. In our\nexperiments over TADPOLE challenge cohort, we measured performance for various\nmetrics and compared our method to competing methods in the literature.\nExhaustive analyses and ablation studies were also conducted to better confirm\nthe effectiveness of our method.",

        "summary": "Sensory input from multiple sources is crucial for robust and coherent human\nperception. Different sources contribute complementary explanatory factors.\nSimilarly, research studies often collect multimodal imaging data, each of\nwhich can provide shared and unique information. This observation motivated the\ndesign of powerful multimodal self-supervised representation-learning\nalgorithms. In this paper, we unify recent work on multimodal self-supervised\nlearning under a single framework. Observing that most self-supervised methods\noptimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a\ntaxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We first evaluate\nmodels on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal\nneuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients. We find that (1)\nmultimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal\ncounterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is\ncritical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the\nsimilarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural\nnetwork, which can sometimes lead to reduced downstream performance but still\nreveal multimodal relations. Results show that the proposed approach\noutperforms previous self-supervised encoder-decoder methods based on canonical\ncorrelation analysis (CCA) or the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational\nautoEncoder (MMVAE) on various datasets with a linear evaluation protocol.\nImportantly, we find a promising solution to uncover connections between\nmodalities through a jointly shared subspace that can help advance work in our\nsearch for neuroimaging biomarkers.",

In this work, we characterize A${\\unicode[Times]{x3B2}}$\nplaques by label-free multimodal imaging: we combine two-photon excitation\nautofluorescence (TPEA), second harmonic generation (SHG), spontaneous Raman\nscattering (SpRS), coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), and stimulated\nRaman scattering (SRS) to describe and compare high-resolution images of\nA${\\unicode[Times]{x3B2}}$ plaques in brain tissues of an AD mouse model.\nComparing single-laser techniques images, we discuss the origin of the SHG,\nwhich can be used to locate the plaque core reliably. We study both the core\nand the halo with vibrational microscopy and compare SpRS and SRS microscopies\nfor different frequencies. We also combine SpRS spectroscopy with SRS\nmicroscopy and present two core biomarkers unexplored with SRS microscopy:\nphenylalanine and amide B. We provide high-resolution SRS images with the\nspatial distribution of these biomarkers in the plaque and compared them with\nimages of the amide I distribution. The obtained spatial correlation\ncorroborates the feasibility of these biomarkers in the study of\nA${\\unicode[Times]{x3B2}}$ plaques. Furthermore, since amide B enables rapid\nimaging, we discuss its potential as a novel fingerprint for diagnostic\napplications.",

        "summary": "Accurate and realistic simulation of high-dimensional medical images has\nbecome an important research area relevant to many AI-enabled healthcare\napplications. However, current state-of-the-art approaches lack the ability to\nproduce satisfactory high-resolution and accurate subject-specific images. In\nthis work, we present a deep learning framework, namely 4D-Degenerative\nAdversarial NeuroImage Net (4D-DANI-Net), to generate high-resolution,\nlongitudinal MRI scans that mimic subject-specific neurodegeneration in ageing\nand dementia. 4D-DANI-Net is a modular framework based on adversarial training\nand a set of novel spatiotemporal, biologically-informed constraints. To ensure\nefficient training and overcome memory limitations affecting such\nhigh-dimensional problems, we rely on three key technological advances: i) a\nnew 3D training consistency mechanism called Profile Weight Functions (PWFs),\nii) a 3D super-resolution module and iii) a transfer learning strategy to\nfine-tune the system for a given individual. To evaluate our approach, we\ntrained the framework on 9852 T1-weighted MRI scans from 876 participants in\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and held out a separate\ntest set of 1283 MRI scans from 170 participants for quantitative and\nqualitative assessment of the personalised time series of synthetic images. We\nperformed three evaluations: i) image quality assessment; ii) quantifying the\naccuracy of regional brain volumes over and above benchmark models; and iii)\nquantifying visual perception of the synthetic images by medical experts.\nOverall, both quantitative and qualitative results show that 4D-DANI-Net\nproduces realistic, low-artefact, personalised time series of synthetic T1 MRI\nthat outperforms benchmark models.",

        "summary": "Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative\ndisease causing parkinsonian symptoms. Altered DNA methylation of the\nmicrotubule-associated protein tau gene correlates with the expression changes\nin Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease brains. However, few studies\nexamine the sequences beyond the constitutive promoter.Objectives: Because\nactivating different microtubule associated protein tau gene control regions\nvia methylation might regulate the differential tau expression constituting the\nspecific signatures of individual tauopathies, we compared methylation of a\ncandidate promoter, intron 0.Methods: We assessed DNA methylation in the brains\nof patients with different tauopathies (35 Alzheimer's disease, 10 corticobasal\ndegeneration, and 18 PSP) and 19 controls by intron 0 pyrosequencing. We also\nevaluated methylation in an independent cohort of 11 PSP cases and 12 controls.\nFrontal (affected by tau pathology) and occipital (unaffected) cortices were\nanalyzed.Results: In the initial samples, one CpG island site in intron 0\n(CpG1) showed significant hypomethylation in PSP-affected frontal cortices when\ncompared with controls (p = 0.022). Such hypomethylation was observed in\nreplicate samples, but not in occipital cortices or other tauopathies. PSP and\ncontrol samples (combining the initial and replicate samples) remained\nsignificantly different after adjustment for potential confounding factors\n(age, H1/H1 diplotype; p = 0.0005). PSP-affected tissues exhibited\nmicrotubule-associated protein tau RNA hyperexpression when compared with\ncontrols (p = 0.004), although no correlation with CpG1 methylation was\nobserved.Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that regions other than\nthe constitutive promoter may be involved in microtubule-associated protein tau\ngene regulation in tauopathies and that intron 0 hypomethylation may be a\nspecific epigenetic signature of PSP.

There\nwas little overlap in clinical questions, tasks and performance metrics.\nWhereas this aids providing insight on a broad range of questions, it also\nlimits the validation of results across challenges. The validation process\nitself was mostly comparable between challenges, using similar methods for\nensuring objective comparison, uncertainty estimation and statistical testing.\nIn general, winning algorithms performed rigorous data preprocessing and\ncombined a wide range of input features.\n  Despite high state-of-the-art performances, most of the methods evaluated by\nthe challenges are not clinically used. To increase impact, future challenges\ncould pay more attention to statistical analysis of which factors relate to\nhigher performance, to clinical questions beyond Alzheimer's disease, and to\nusing testing data beyond the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.\nGrand challenges would be an ideal venue for assessing the generalizability of\nalgorithm performance to unseen data of other cohorts.

        "summary": "Background and Purpose: Altered brain vasculature is a key phenomenon in\nseveral neurologic disorders. This paper presents a quantitative assessment of\nvascular morphology in healthy and diseased adults including changes during\naging and the anatomical variations in the Circle of Willis (CoW). Methods: We\nused our automatic method to segment and extract novel geometric features of\nthe cerebral vasculature from MRA scans of 175 healthy subjects, 45 AIS, and 50\nAD patients after spatial registration. This is followed by quantification and\nstatistical analysis of vascular alterations in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and\nAlzheimer's disease (AD), the biggest cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative\ndisorders. Results: We determined that the CoW is fully formed in only 35\npercent of healthy adults and found significantly increased tortuosity and\nfractality, with increasing age and with disease -- both AIS and AD. We also\nfound significantly decreased vessel length, volume and number of branches in\nAIS patients. Lastly, we found that AD cerebral vessels exhibited significantly\nsmaller diameter and more complex branching patterns, compared to age-matched\nhealthy adults. These changes were significantly heightened with progression of\nAD from early onset to moderate-severe dementia. Conclusion: Altered vessel\ngeometry in AIS patients shows that there is pathological morphology coupled\nwith stroke. In AD due to pathological alterations in the endothelium or\namyloid depositions leading to neuronal damage and hypoperfusion, vessel\ngeometry is significantly altered even in mild or early dementia. The specific\ngeometric features and quantitative comparisons demonstrate potential for using\nvascular morphology as a non-invasive imaging biomarker for neurologic\ndisorders.",

Knowledge graphs can provide comprehensive and semantic\nrepresentation for heterogeneous data, and have been successfully leveraged in\nmany biomedical applications including drug repurposing. Our objective is to\nconstruct a knowledge graph from literature to study relations between\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) and chemicals, drugs and dietary supplements in order\nto identify opportunities to prevent or delay neurodegenerative progression. We\ncollected biomedical annotations and extracted their relations using SemRep via\nSemMedDB. We used both a BERT-based classifier and rule-based methods during\ndata preprocessing to exclude noise while preserving most AD-related semantic\ntriples. The 1,672,110 filtered triples were used to train with knowledge graph\ncompletion algorithms (i.e., TransE, DistMult, and ComplEx) to predict\ncandidates that might be helpful for AD treatment or prevention. Among three\nknowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed the other two (MR =\n13.45, Hits@1 = 0.306). We leveraged the time-slicing technique to further\nevaluate the prediction results. We found supporting evidence for most highly\nranked candidates predicted by our model which indicates that our approach can\ninform reliable new knowledge. This paper shows that our graph mining model can\npredict reliable new relationships between AD and other entities (i.e., dietary\nsupplements, chemicals, and drugs).

A major\nbottleneck for conducting such research is that the traditional way to acquire\nsleep information is time-consuming, inefficient, non-scalable, and limited to\npatients' subjective experience. A gold standard dataset is created from manual\nannotation of 570 randomly sampled clinical note documents from the adSLEEP, a\ncorpus of 192,000 de-identified clinical notes of 7,266 AD patients retrieved\nfrom the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We developed a\nrule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm, machine learning\nmodels, and Large Language Model(LLM)-based NLP algorithms to automate the\nextraction of sleep-related concepts, including snoring, napping, sleep\nproblem, bad sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, night wakings, and sleep\nduration, from the gold standard dataset. Rule-based NLP algorithm achieved the\nbest performance of F1 across all sleep-related concepts. In terms of Positive\nPredictive Value (PPV), rule-based NLP algorithm achieved 1.00 for daytime\nsleepiness and sleep duration, machine learning models: 0.95 and for napping,\n0.86 for bad sleep quality and 0.90 for snoring; and LLAMA2 with finetuning\nachieved PPV of 0.93 for Night Wakings, 0.89 for sleep problem, and 1.00 for\nsleep duration.

        "summary": "To understand multifactorial conditions such as Alzheimers disease (AD) we\nneed brain signatures that predict the impact of multiple pathologies and their\ninteractions. To help uncover the relationships between brain circuits and\ncognitive markers we have used mouse models that represent, at least in part,\nthe complex interactions altered in AD. In particular, we aimed to understand\nthe relationship between vulnerable brain circuits and memory deficits measured\nin the Morris water maze, and we tested several predictive modeling approaches.\nWe used in vivo manganese enhanced MRI voxel based analyses to reveal regional\ndifferences in volume (morphometry), signal intensity (activity), and magnetic\nsusceptibility (iron deposition, demyelination). These regions included the\nhippocampus, olfactory areas, entorhinal cortex and cerebellum. The image based\nproperties of these regions were used to predict spatial memory. We next used\neigenanatomy, which reduces dimensionality to produce sets of regions that\nexplain the variance in the data. For each imaging marker, eigenanatomy\nrevealed networks underpinning a range of cognitive functions including memory,\nmotor function, and associative learning. Finally, the integration of\nmultivariate markers in a supervised sparse canonical correlation approach\noutperformed single predictor models and had significant correlates to spatial\nmemory. Among a priori selected regions, the fornix also provided good\npredictors, raising the possibility of investigating how disease propagation\nwithin brain networks leads to cognitive deterioration. Our results support\nthat modeling approaches integrating multivariate imaging markers provide\nsensitive predictors of AD-like behaviors. Such strategies for mapping brain\ncircuits responsible for behaviors may help in the future predict disease\nprogression, or response to interventions.",

        "title": "Reproducible evaluation of diffusion MRI features for automatic\n  classification of patients with Alzheimers disease",
        "summary": "Diffusion MRI is the modality of choice to study alterations of white matter.\nIn past years, various works have used diffusion MRI for automatic\nclassification of AD. However, classification performance obtained with\ndifferent approaches is difficult to compare and these studies are also\ndifficult to reproduce. In the present paper, we first extend a previously\nproposed framework to diffusion MRI data for AD classification. Specifically,\nwe add: conversion of diffusion MRI ADNI data into the BIDS standard and\npipelines for diffusion MRI preprocessing and feature extraction. We then apply\nthe framework to compare different components. First, FS has a positive impact\non classification results: highest balanced accuracy (BA) improved from 0.76 to\n0.82 for task CN vs AD. Secondly, voxel-wise features generally gives better\nperformance than regional features. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean\ndiffusivity (MD) provided comparable results for voxel-wise features. Moreover,\nwe observe that the poor performance obtained in tasks involving MCI were\npotentially caused by the small data samples, rather than by the data\nimbalance. Furthermore, no extensive classification difference exists for\ndifferent degree of smoothing and registration methods. Besides, we demonstrate\nthat using non-nested validation of FS leads to unreliable and over-optimistic\nresults: 0.05 up to 0.40 relative increase in BA. Lastly, with proper FR and\nFS, the performance of diffusion MRI features is comparable to that of T1w MRI.\nAll the code of the framework and the experiments are publicly available:\ngeneral-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software package\n(www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-ML.",

        "summary": "Aggregates of misfolded tau proteins (or just 'tau' for brevity) play a\ncrucial role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as they correlate\nwith cell death and accelerated tissue atrophy. Longitudinal positron emission\ntomography (PET) scans can be used quantify the extend of abnormal tau spread.\nSuch PET-based image biomarkers are a promising technology for AD diagnosis and\nprognosis. Here, we propose to calibrate an organ-scale biophysical\nmathematical model using longitudinal PET scans to extract characteristic\ngrowth patterns and spreading of tau. The biophysical model is a\nreaction-advection-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) with only two\nscalar unknown parameters, one representing the spreading (the diffusion part\nof the PDE) and the other one the growth of tau (the reaction part of the PDE).\nThe advection term captures tissue atrophy and is obtained from diffeomorphic\nregistration of longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We\ndescribe the method, present a numerical scheme for the calibration of the\ngrowth and spreading parameters, perform a sensitivity study using synthetic\ndata, and we perform a preliminary evaluation on clinical scans from the ADNI\ndataset. We study whether such model calibration is possible and investigate\nthe sensitivity of such calibration to the time between consecutive scans and\nthe presence of atrophy. Our findings show that despite using only two\ncalibration parameters, the model can reconstruct clinical scans quite\naccurately. We discovered that small time intervals between scans and the\npresence of background noise create difficulties. Our reconstructed model fits\nthe data well, yet the study on clinical data also reveals shortcomings of the\nsimplistic model. Interestingly, the parameters show significant variability\nacross patients, an indication that these parameters could be useful\nbiomarkers.",

        "summary": "Converging evidence shows that disease-relevant brain alterations do not\nappear in random brain locations, instead, its spatial pattern follows large\nscale brain networks. In this context, a powerful network analysis approach\nwith a mathematical foundation is indispensable to understand the mechanism of\nneuropathological events spreading throughout the brain. Indeed, the topology\nof each brain network is governed by its native harmonic waves, which are a set\nof orthogonal bases derived from the Eigen-system of the underlying Laplacian\nmatrix. To that end, we propose a novel connectome harmonic analysis framework\nto provide enhanced mathematical insights by detecting frequency-based\nalterations relevant to brain disorders. The backbone of our framework is a\nnovel manifold algebra appropriate for inference across harmonic waves that\novercomes the limitations of using classic Euclidean operations on irregular\ndata structures. The individual harmonic difference is measured by a set of\ncommon harmonic waves learned from a population of individual Eigen systems,\nwhere each native Eigen-system is regarded as a sample drawn from the Stiefel\nmanifold. Specifically, a manifold optimization scheme is tailored to find the\ncommon harmonic waves which reside at the center of Stiefel manifold. To that\nend, the common harmonic waves constitute the new neuro-biological bases to\nunderstand disease progression. Each harmonic wave exhibits a unique\npropagation pattern of neuro-pathological burdens spreading across brain\nnetworks. The statistical power of our novel connectome harmonic analysis\napproach is evaluated by identifying frequency-based alterations relevant to\nAlzheimer's disease, where our learning-based manifold approach discovers more\nsignificant and reproducible network dysfunction patterns compared to Euclidian\nmethods.",

        "summary": "The concept of biological age (BA), although important in clinical practice,\nis hard to grasp mainly due to the lack of a clearly defined reference\nstandard. For specific applications, especially in pediatrics, medical image\ndata are used for BA estimation in a routine clinical context. Beyond this\nyoung age group, BA estimation is mostly restricted to whole-body assessment\nusing non-imaging indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular\ndata. However, various organ systems may exhibit different aging\ncharacteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body\nassessment of the BA does not reflect the deviations of aging behavior between\norgans. To this end, we propose a new imaging-based framework for\norgan-specific BA estimation. In this initial study, we focus mainly on brain\nMRI. As a first step, we introduce a chronological age (CA) estimation\nframework using deep convolutional neural networks (Age-Net). We quantitatively\nassess the performance of this framework in comparison to existing\nstate-of-the-art CA estimation approaches. Furthermore, we expand upon Age-Net\nwith a novel iterative data-cleaning algorithm to segregate atypical-aging\npatients (BA $\\not \\approx$ CA) from the given population. We hypothesize that\nthe remaining population should approximate the true BA behavior. We apply the\nproposed methodology on a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) dataset\ncontaining healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer's patients with different\ndementia ratings. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and\nthe expected cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's patients.

It supports the validity to develop sMRI-based univariate\nneurodegeneration biomarkers (UNB). However, existing UNB work either fails to\nmodel large group variances or does not capture AD dementia (ADD) induced\nchanges. We propose a novel low-rank and sparse subspace decomposition method\ncapable of stably quantifying the morphological changes induced by ADD.\nSpecifically, we propose a numerically efficient rank minimization mechanism to\nextract group common structure and impose regularization constraints to encode\nthe original 3D morphometry connectivity. Further, we generate\nregions-of-interest (ROI) with group difference study between common subspaces\nof $A\\beta+$ AD and $A\\beta-$ cognitively unimpaired (CU) groups. A univariate\nmorphometry index (UMI) is constructed from these ROIs by summarizing\nindividual morphological characteristics weighted by normalized difference\nbetween $A\\beta+$ AD and $A\\beta-$ CU groups. We use hippocampal surface radial\ndistance feature to compute the UMIs and validate our work in the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. With hippocampal UMIs, the\nestimated minimum sample sizes needed to detect a 25$\\%$ reduction in the mean\nannual change with 80$\\%$ power and two-tailed $P=0.05$ are 116, 279 and 387\nfor the longitudinal $A\\beta+$ AD, $A\\beta+$ mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\nand $A\\beta+$ CU groups, respectively. Additionally, for MCI patients, UMIs\nwell correlate with hazard ratio of conversion to AD ($4.3$, $95\\%$\nCI=$2.3-8.2$) within 18 months.

Regarding brain regions as systems, voxels as particles, and\nintensity of signals as energy of particles, the thermodynamic model of brain\nwas built based on canonical ensemble theory. Two pairs of activated regions\nand two pairs of inactivated brain regions were selected for comparison in this\nstudy, and the analysis on thermodynamic properties based on the model proposed\nwere performed.

        "summary": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important tool for studying\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). PET scans can be used as diagnostics tools, and to\nprovide molecular characterization of patients with cognitive disorders.\nHowever, multiple tracers are needed to measure glucose metabolism (18F-FDG),\nsynaptic vesicle protein (11C-UCB-J), and $\\beta$-amyloid (11C-PiB).\nAdministering multiple tracers to patient will lead to high radiation dose and\ncost. In addition, access to PET scans using new or less-available tracers with\nsophisticated production methods and short half-life isotopes may be very\nlimited. Thus, it is desirable to develop an efficient multi-tracer PET\nsynthesis model that can generate multi-tracer PET from single-tracer PET.\nPrevious works on medical image synthesis focus on one-to-one fixed domain\ntranslations, and cannot simultaneously learn the feature from multi-tracer\ndomains. Given 3 or more tracers, relying on previous methods will also create\na heavy burden on the number of models to be trained. To tackle these issues,\nwe propose a 3D unified anatomy-aware cyclic adversarial network (UCAN) for\ntranslating multi-tracer PET volumes with one unified generative model, where\nMR with anatomical information is incorporated. Evaluations on a multi-tracer\nPET dataset demonstrate the feasibility that our UCAN can generate high-quality\nmulti-tracer PET volumes, with NMSE less than 15% for all PET tracers.",

        "title": "Brain-Aware Replacements for Supervised Contrastive Learning in\n  Detection of Alzheimer's Disease",
        "summary": "We propose a novel framework for Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection using\nbrain MRIs. The framework starts with a data augmentation method called\nBrain-Aware Replacements (BAR), which leverages a standard brain parcellation\nto replace medically-relevant 3D brain regions in an anchor MRI from a randomly\npicked MRI to create synthetic samples. Ground truth \"hard\" labels are also\nlinearly mixed depending on the replacement ratio in order to create \"soft\"\nlabels. BAR produces a great variety of realistic-looking synthetic MRIs with\nhigher local variability compared to other mix-based methods, such as CutMix.\nOn top of BAR, we propose using a soft-label-capable supervised contrastive\nloss, aiming to learn the relative similarity of representations that reflect\nhow mixed are the synthetic MRIs using our soft labels. This way, we do not\nfully exhaust the entropic capacity of our hard labels, since we only use them\nto create soft labels and synthetic MRIs through BAR. We show that a model\npre-trained using our framework can be further fine-tuned with a cross-entropy\nloss using the hard labels that were used to create the synthetic samples. We\nvalidated the performance of our framework in a binary AD detection task\nagainst both from-scratch supervised training and state-of-the-art\nself-supervised training plus fine-tuning approaches. Then we evaluated BAR's\nindividual performance compared to another mix-based method CutMix by\nintegrating it within our framework. We show that our framework yields superior\nresults in both precision and recall for the AD detection task.",

        "title": "Self-supervised multimodal neuroimaging yields predictive\n  representations for a spectrum of Alzheimer's phenotypes",
        "summary": "Recent neuroimaging studies that focus on predicting brain disorders via\nmodern machine learning approaches commonly include a single modality and rely\non supervised over-parameterized models.However, a single modality provides\nonly a limited view of the highly complex brain. Critically, supervised models\nin clinical settings lack accurate diagnostic labels for training. Coarse\nlabels do not capture the long-tailed spectrum of brain disorder phenotypes,\nwhich leads to a loss of generalizability of the model that makes them less\nuseful in diagnostic settings. This work presents a novel multi-scale\ncoordinated framework for learning multiple representations from multimodal\nneuroimaging data. We propose a general taxonomy of informative inductive\nbiases to capture unique and joint information in multimodal self-supervised\nfusion. The taxonomy forms a family of decoder-free models with reduced\ncomputational complexity and a propensity to capture multi-scale relationships\nbetween local and global representations of the multimodal inputs. We conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the taxonomy using functional and structural\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across a spectrum of Alzheimer's disease\nphenotypes and show that self-supervised models reveal disorder-relevant brain\nregions and multimodal links without access to the labels during pre-training.\nThe proposed multimodal self-supervised learning yields representations with\nimproved classification performance for both modalities. The concomitant rich\nand flexible unsupervised deep learning framework captures complex multimodal\nrelationships and provides predictive performance that meets or exceeds that of\na more narrow supervised classification analysis. We present elaborate\nquantitative evidence of how this framework can significantly advance our\nsearch for missing links in complex brain disorders.",

        "summary": "Accurate medical classification requires a large number of multi-modal data,\nand in many cases, different feature types. Previous studies have shown\npromising results when using multi-modal data, outperforming single-modality\nmodels when classifying diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However,\nthose models are usually not flexible enough to handle missing modalities.\nCurrently, the most common workaround is discarding samples with missing\nmodalities which leads to considerable data under-utilization. Adding to the\nfact that labeled medical images are already scarce, the performance of\ndata-driven methods like deep learning can be severely hampered. Therefore, a\nmulti-modal method that can handle missing data in various clinical settings is\nhighly desirable. In this paper, we present Multi-Modal Mixing Transformer\n(3MAT), a disease classification transformer that not only leverages\nmulti-modal data but also handles missing data scenarios. In this work, we test\n3MT for AD and Cognitively normal (CN) classification and mild cognitive\nimpairment (MCI) conversion prediction to progressive MCI (pMCI) or stable MCI\n(sMCI) using clinical and neuroimaging data. The model uses a novel Cascaded\nModality Transformer architecture with cross-attention to incorporate\nmulti-modal information for more informed predictions. We propose a novel\nmodality dropout mechanism to ensure an unprecedented level of modality\nindependence and robustness to handle missing data scenarios. The result is a\nversatile network that enables the mixing of arbitrary numbers of modalities\nwith different feature types and also ensures full data utilization missing\ndata scenarios. The model is trained and evaluated on the ADNI dataset with the\nSOTRA performance and further evaluated with the AIBL dataset with missing\ndata.",

        "summary": "Background. Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) are characterized\nby multiple and progressive anatomo clinical changes. Yet, modeling changes\nover disease course from cohort data is challenging as the usual timescales are\ninappropriate and time-to-clinical diagnosis is available on small subsamples\nof participants with short follow-up durations prior to diagnosis. One solution\nto circumvent this challenge is to define the disease time as a latent\nvariable.\n  Methods: We developed a multivariate mixed model approach that realigns\nindividual trajectories into the latent disease time to describe disease\nprogression. Our methodology exploits the clinical diagnosis information as a\npartially observed and approximate reference to guide the estimation of the\nlatent disease time. The model estimation was carried out in the Bayesian\nFramework using Stan. We applied the methodology to 2186 participants of the\nMEMENTO study with 5-year follow-up. Repeated measures of 12 ADRD markers\nstemmed from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain imaging and cognitive tests were\nanalyzed.\n  Result: The estimated latent disease time spanned over twenty years before\nthe clinical diagnosis. Considering the profile of a woman aged 70 with a high\nlevel of education and APOE4 carrier (the main genetic risk factor for ADRD),\nCSF markers of tau proteins accumulation preceded markers of brain atrophy by 5\nyears and cognitive decline by 10 years. We observed that individual\ncharacteristics could substantially modify the sequence and timing of these\nchanges.\n  Conclusion: Our disease progression model does not only realign trajectories\ninto the most homogeneous way. It accounts for the inherent residual\ninter-individual variability in dementia progression to describe the long-term\nchanges according to the years preceding clinical diagnosis, and to provide\nclinically meaningful information on the sequence of events.",

        "summary": "Although neurocognitive models have been proposed to explain anosognosia in\nAlzheimer's disease (AD), the neural cascade responsible for its origin in the\nhuman brain remains unknown. Here, we build on a mechanistic dual-path\nhypothesis that brings error-monitoring and emotional processing systems as key\nelements for self-awareness, with distinct impacts on the emergence of\nanosognosia in AD. Proceeding from the notion of anosognosia as a dimensional\nsyndrome, ranging from the lack of concern about one's own deficits (i.e.,\nanosodiaphoria) to the complete lack of awareness of deficits, our hypothesis\nstates that (i) unawareness of deficits would result from a failure in the\nerror-monitoring system, whereas (ii) anosodiaphoria would more likely result\nfrom an imbalance between emotional processing and error-monitoring systems. In\nthe first case, a synaptic failure in the error-monitoring system, in which the\ncingulate cortex plays a major role, would have a negative impact on error (or\ndeficits) awareness, preventing patients from becoming aware of their\ncondition. In the second case, an impairment in the emotional processing\nsystem, in which the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex play a major role, would\nprevent patients from monitoring the internal milieu for relevant errors (or\ndeficits) and assigning appropriate value to them, thus biasing their impact on\nthe error-monitoring system. Our hypothesis stems from two scientific premises.\nOne comes from preliminary results in AD patients showing a synaptic failure in\nthe error-monitoring system and decline of awareness at the time of diagnosis.\nAnother comes from the somatic marker hypothesis, which proposes that emotional\nsignals are critical to adaptive behavior. Further exploration will be of great\ninterest to illuminate the foundations of self-awareness and improve our\nunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms of anosognosia in AD.",

In this study, we propose a DL-based methodology for\nsemantic segmentation of tau lesions (i.e., neuritic plaques) in WSI of\npostmortem patients with AD. The state of the art in semantic segmentation of\nneuritic plaques in human WSI is very limited. Our study proposes a baseline\nable to generate a significant advantage for morphological analysis of these\ntauopathies for further stratification of AD patients. Essential discussions\nconcerning biomarkers (ALZ50 versus AT8 tau antibodies), the imaging modality\n(different slide scanner resolutions), and the challenge of weak annotations\nare addressed within this seminal study. The analysis of the impact of context\nin plaque segmentation is important to understand the role of the\nmicro-environment for reliable tau protein segmentation. In addition, by\nintegrating visual interpretability, we are able to explain how the network\nfocuses on a region of interest (ROI), giving additional insights to\npathologists.

Methods: Using data\nobtained from different institutions, we develop a surface-based federated Chow\ntest model to study the synergistic effects of APOE, a previously reported\nsignificant risk factor of AD, and tau on hippocampal surface morphometry.\nResults: We illustrate that the APOE-specific morphometry features correlate\nwith AD progression and better predict future AD conversion than other MRI\nbiomarkers. For example, a strong association between atrophy and abnormal tau\nwas identified in hippocampal subregion cornu ammonis 1 (CA1 subfield) and\nsubiculum in e4 homozygote cohort.

To optimize the diagnostic process, numerous efforts have been\ndirected towards the development of deep learning approaches (DL) for the\nautomatic AD classification. However, their typical black box outline has led\nto low trust and scarce usage within clinical frameworks. In this work, we\npropose two state-of-the art DL models, trained respectively on structural MRI\n(ResNet18) and brain connectivity matrixes (BC-GCN-SE) derived from diffusion\ndata. The models were initially evaluated in terms of classification accuracy.\nThen, results were analyzed using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)\napproach (Grad-CAM) to measure the level of interpretability of both models.\nThe XAI assessment was conducted across 132 brain parcels, extracted from a\ncombination of the Harvard-Oxford and AAL brain atlases, and compared to\nwell-known pathological regions to measure adherence to domain knowledge.\nResults highlighted acceptable classification performance as compared to the\nexisting literature (ResNet18: TPRmedian = 0.817, TNRmedian = 0.816; BC-GCN-SE:\nTPRmedian = 0.703, TNRmedian = 0.738). As evaluated through a statistical test\n(p < 0.05) and ranking of the most relevant parcels (first 15%), Grad-CAM\nrevealed the involvement of target brain areas for both the ResNet18 and\nBC-GCN-SE models: the medial temporal lobe and the default mode network.

Nevertheless, results\nsuggested that combining different imaging modalities may result in increased\nclassification performance and model reliability. This could potentially boost\nthe confidence laid in DL models and favor their wide applicability as aid\ndiagnostic tools.",

Second, it aims to demonstrate that such\naspects of the lexicon, when used as features of a machine learning classifier,\ncan help achieve state-of-the-art performance in automatically identifying\nlanguage samples produced by patients with AD. Methods: data is derived from\nthe ADDreSS challenge, which is a part of the DementiaBank corpus. The used\ndataset consists of transcripts of Cookie Theft picture descriptions, produced\nby 54 subjects in the training part and 24 subjects in the test part. The\nnumber of narrative samples is 108 in the training set and 48 in the test set.\nFirst, the impact of AD on 99 selected lexical features is studied using both\nthe training and testing parts of the dataset. Then some machine learning\nexperiments were conducted on the task of classifying transcribed speech\nsamples with text samples that were produced by people with AD from those\nproduced by normal subjects.

To evaluate the generalization of the models built on\nnarrative speech, two generalization tests were conducted using written data\nfrom two British authors, Iris Murdoch and Agatha Christie, and the\ntranscription of some speeches by former President Ronald Reagan. Results:\nusing lexical features only, state-of-the-art classification, F1 and\naccuracies, of over 91% were achieved in categorizing language samples produced\nby individuals with AD from the ones produced by healthy control subjects. This\nconfirms the substantial impact of AD on lexicon processing.",

        "summary": "Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for timely\nintervention and treatment. This study aims to use machine learning approaches\nto analyze longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with AD\nand identify signs and symptoms that can predict AD onset earlier. We used a\ncase-control design with longitudinal EHRs from the U.S. Department of Veterans\nAffairs Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from 2004 to 2021. Cases were VHA\npatients with AD diagnosed after 1/1/2016 based on ICD-10-CM codes, matched 1:9\nwith controls by age, sex and clinical utilization with replacement. We used a\npanel of AD-related keywords and their occurrences over time in a patient's\nlongitudinal EHRs as predictors for AD prediction with four machine learning\nmodels. We performed subgroup analyses by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, and\nvalidated the model in a hold-out and \"unseen\" VHA stations group. Model\ndiscrimination, calibration, and other relevant metrics were reported for\npredictions up to ten years before ICD-based diagnosis. The study population\nincluded 16,701 cases and 39,097 matched controls. The average number of\nAD-related keywords (e.g., \"concentration\", \"speaking\") per year increased\nrapidly for cases as diagnosis approached, from around 10 to over 40, while\nremaining flat at 10 for controls. The best model achieved high discriminative\naccuracy (ROCAUC 0.997) for predictions using data from at least ten years\nbefore ICD-based diagnoses. The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow\ngoodness-of-fit p-value = 0.99) and consistent across subgroups of age, sex and\nrace/ethnicity, except for patients younger than 65 (ROCAUC 0.746). Machine\nlearning models using AD-related keywords identified from EHR notes can predict\nfuture AD diagnoses, suggesting its potential use for identifying AD risk using\nEHR notes, offering an affordable way for early screening on large population.",

        "summary": "In recent years, deep learning models have been applied to neuroimaging data\nfor early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images provide structural\nand functional information about the brain, respectively. Combining these\nfeatures leads to improved performance than using a single modality alone in\nbuilding predictive models for AD diagnosis. However, current multi-modal\napproaches in deep learning, based on sMRI and PET, are mostly limited to\nconvolutional neural networks, which do not facilitate integration of both\nimage and phenotypic information of subjects. We propose to use graph neural\nnetworks (GNN) that are designed to deal with problems in non-Euclidean\ndomains. In this study, we demonstrate how brain networks can be created from\nsMRI or PET images and be used in a population graph framework that can combine\nphenotypic information with imaging features of these brain networks. Then, we\npresent a multi-modal GNN framework where each modality has its own branch of\nGNN and a technique is proposed to combine the multi-modal data at both the\nlevel of node vectors and adjacency matrices. Finally, we perform late fusion\nto combine the preliminary decisions made in each branch and produce a final\nprediction. As multi-modality data becomes available, multi-source and\nmulti-modal is the trend of AD diagnosis. We conducted explorative experiments\nbased on multi-modal imaging data combined with non-imaging phenotypic\ninformation for AD diagnosis and analyzed the impact of phenotypic information\non diagnostic performance. Results from experiments demonstrated that our\nproposed multi-modal approach improves performance for AD diagnosis, and this\nstudy also provides technical reference and support the need for multivariate\nmulti-modal diagnosis methods.",

In this paper, we analyse the process of misfolding and\nspreading of both $\\alpha$-synuclein and Amyloid-$\\beta$, related to\nParkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, respectively. We introduce and analyze a\npositivity-preserving numerical method for the discretization of the\nFisher-Kolmogorov equation, modelling accumulation and spreading of prionic\nproteins. The proposed approximation method is based on the discontinuous\nGalerkin method on polygonal and polyhedral grids for space discretization and\non $\\vartheta-$method time integration scheme. We prove the existence of the\ndiscrete solution and a convergence result where the Implicit Euler scheme is\nemployed for time integration. We show that the proposed approach is\nstructure-preserving, in the sense that it guaranteed that the discrete\nsolution is non-negative, a feature that is of paramount importance in\npractical application. The numerical verification of our numerical model is\nperformed both using a manufactured solution and considering wavefront\npropagation in two-dimensional polygonal grids. Next, we present a simulation\nof $\\alpha$-synuclein spreading in a two-dimensional brain slice in the\nsagittal plane. The polygonal mesh for this simulation is agglomerated\nmaintaining the distinction of white and grey matter, taking advantage of the\nflexibility of PolyDG methods in the mesh construction. Finally, we simulate\nthe spreading of Amyloid-$\\beta$ in a patient-specific setting by using a\nthree-dimensional geometry reconstructed from magnetic resonance images and an\ninitial condition reconstructed from positron emission tomography.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease and normal aging are both characterized by brain atrophy.\nThe question of whether AD-related brain atrophy represents accelerated aging\nor a neurodegeneration process distinct from that in normal aging remains\nunresolved. Moreover, precisely disentangling AD-related brain atrophy from\nnormal aging in a clinical context is complex. In this study, we propose a\ndeformation-based morphometry framework to estimate normal aging and\nAD-specific atrophy patterns of subjects from morphological MRI scans. We first\nleverage deep-learning-based methods to create age-dependent templates of\ncognitively normal (CN) subjects. These templates model the normal aging\natrophy patterns in a CN population. Then, we use the learned diffeomorphic\nregistration to estimate the one-year normal aging pattern at the voxel level.\nWe register the testing image to the 60-year-old CN template in the second\nstep. Finally, normal aging and AD-specific scores are estimated by measuring\nthe alignment of this registration with the one-year normal aging pattern. The\nmethodology was developed and evaluated on the OASIS3 dataset with 1,014\nT1-weighted MRI scans. Of these, 326 scans were from CN subjects, and 688 scans\nwere from individuals clinically diagnosed with AD at different stages of\nclinical severity defined by clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores. The results\nshow that ventricles predominantly follow an accelerated normal aging pattern\nin subjects with AD. In turn, hippocampi and amygdala regions were affected by\nboth normal aging and AD-specific factors. Interestingly, hippocampi and\namygdala regions showed more of an accelerated normal aging pattern for\nsubjects during the early clinical stages of the disease, while the AD-specific\nscore increases in later clinical stages.

        "summary": "One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation and\nspread of toxic aggregates of tau protein. The progression of AD tau pathology\nis thought to be highly stereotyped, which is in part due to the fact that tau\ncan spread between regions via the white matter tracts that connect them.\nMathematically, this phenomenon has been described using models of \"network\ndiffusion\", where the rate of spread of tau between brain regions is\nproportional to its concentration gradient and the amount of white matter\nbetween them. Although these models can robustly predict the progression of\npathology in a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, an\nunder explored aspect of tau spreading is that it is governed not simply by\ndiffusion but also active transport along axonal microtubules. Spread can\ntherefore take on a directional bias, resulting in distinct patterns of\ndeposition, but current models struggle to capture this phenomenon. Recently,\nwe have developed a mathematical model of the axonal transport of toxic tau\nproteins that takes into account the effects tau exerts on the molecular\nmotors. Here we describe and implement a macroscopic version of this model,\nwhich we call the Network Transport Model (NTM). A key feature of this model is\nthat, while it predicts tau dynamics at a regional level, it is parameterized\nin terms of only microscopic processes such as aggregation and transport rates;\nthat is, differences in brain-wide tau progression can be explained by its\nmicroscopic properties. We provide numerical evidence that, as with the\ntwo-neuron model that the NTM extends, there are distinct and rich dynamics\nwith respect to the overall rate of spread and the staging of pathology when we\nsimulated the NTM on the hippocampal subnetwork. The theoretical insights\nprovided by the NTM have broad implications for understanding AD\npathophysiology more generally.",

        "summary": "An important task in health research is to characterize time-to-event\noutcomes such as disease onset or mortality in terms of a potentially\nhigh-dimensional set of risk factors. For example, prospective cohort studies\nof Alzheimer's disease typically enroll older adults for observation over\nseveral decades to assess the long-term impact of genetic and other factors on\ncognitive decline and mortality. The accelerated failure time model is\nparticularly well-suited to such studies, structuring covariate effects as\n`horizontal' changes to the survival quantiles that conceptually reflect shifts\nin the outcome distribution due to lifelong exposures. However, this modeling\ntask is complicated by the enrollment of adults at differing ages, and\nintermittent followup visits leading to interval censored outcome information.\nMoreover, genetic and clinical risk factors are not only high-dimensional, but\ncharacterized by underlying grouping structure, such as by function or gene\nlocation. Such grouped high-dimensional covariates require shrinkage methods\nthat directly acknowledge this structure to facilitate variable selection and\nestimation. In this paper, we address these considerations directly by\nproposing a Bayesian accelerated failure time model with a group-structured\nlasso penalty, designed for left-truncated and interval-censored time-to-event\ndata. We develop a custom Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler for efficient\nestimation, and investigate the impact of various methods of penalty tuning and\nthresholding for variable selection. We present a simulation study examining\nthe performance of this method relative to models with an ordinary lasso\npenalty, and apply the proposed method to identify groups of predictive genetic\nand clinical risk factors for Alzheimer's disease in the Religious Orders Study\nand Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) prospective cohort studies of AD and\ndementia.",

We validated our method using Dice\nCoefficient (DSC) and Average Hausdorff distance (AVD) across in vivo images\nfrom six different datasets with six different MRI sequences (T1, T2, proton\ndensity, quantitative T1, fractional anisotrophy, and FLAIR). Statistical\nanalysis compared hypothalamic subregion volumes in controls, Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD), and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) subjects\nusing the Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) and\nWilcoxon rank sum test.

Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and\nintervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further\ndeterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images\nof an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future.\nHowever, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution\nare two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To\nthis end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network\n(MST-former) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential\nimage inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information\nfrom sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically,\nwe employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions,\nwhich can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image.\nBesides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a\nnon-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled\ndata. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax\nCross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments\non the Sequential fundus Images for Glaucoma Forecast (SIGF) dataset\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed MST-former method, achieving an AUC\nof 98.6% for glaucoma forecasting.

        "summary": "Independent life of the individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD)\nis compromised due to their memory loss. As a result, they depend on others to\nhelp them lead their daily life. In this situation, either the family members\nor the caregivers offer their help; they attach notes on every single object or\ntake out the contents of a drawer to make those visible when they leave the\npatient alone. The aim of this thesis is to provide multi-level support and\nsome helping means for AD patients and their family members through the\nintegration of existing science and methods. This study reports results on an\nintelligent assistive (IA) system, achieved through the integration of Internet\nof Things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), and adaptive fuzzy decision-making\nmethods. The proposed system has four main components; (1) a location and\nheading data stored in the local fog layer, (2) an AR device to make\ninteractions with the AD patient, (3) a supervisory decision-maker to handle\nthe direct and environmental interactions with the patient, (4) and a user\ninterface for family or caregivers to monitor the patient's real-time situation\nand send reminders once required. The system operates in different modes,\nincluding automated and semi-automated. The first one helps the user complete\nthe activities in their daily life by showing AR messages or making automatic\nchanges. The second one allows manual changes after the real-time assessment of\nthe user's cognitive state based on the AR game score. We provide further\nevidence that the accuracy, reliability and response time of the IA system are\nappropriate to be implemented in AD patients' homes. Moreover, the system\nresponse in the semi-automated mode causes less data loss than the automated\nmode, as the number of active devices decreases.",

        "summary": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard modality to understand human\nbrain structure and function in vivo (antemortem). Decades of research in human\nneuroimaging has led to the widespread development of methods and tools to\nprovide automated volume-based segmentations and surface-based parcellations\nwhich help localize brain functions to specialized anatomical regions. Recently\nex vivo (postmortem) imaging of the brain has opened-up avenues to study brain\nstructure at sub-millimeter ultra high-resolution revealing details not\npossible to observe with in vivo MRI. Unfortunately, there has been limited\nmethodological development in ex vivo MRI primarily due to lack of datasets and\nlimited centers with such imaging resources. Therefore, in this work, we\npresent one-of-its-kind dataset of 82 ex vivo T2w whole brain hemispheres MRI\nat 0.3 mm isotropic resolution spanning Alzheimer's disease and related\ndementias. We adapted and developed a fast and easy-to-use automated\nsurface-based pipeline to parcellate, for the first time, ultra high-resolution\nex vivo brain tissue at the native subject space resolution using the\nDesikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) brain atlas. This allows us to perform\nvertex-wise analysis in the template space and thereby link morphometry\nmeasures with pathology measurements derived from histology.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sleep disorders exhibit a close association,\nwhere disruptions in sleep patterns often precede the onset of Mild Cognitive\nImpairment (MCI) and early-stage AD. This study delves into the potential of\nutilizing sleep-related electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquired through\npolysomnography (PSG) for the early detection of AD. Our primary focus is on\nexploring semi-supervised Deep Learning techniques for the classification of\nEEG signals due to the clinical scenario characterized by the limited data\navailability. The methodology entails testing and comparing the performance of\nsemi-supervised SMATE and TapNet models, benchmarked against the supervised XCM\nmodel, and unsupervised Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The study highlights the\nsignificance of spatial and temporal analysis capabilities, conducting\nindependent analyses of each sleep stage. Results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof SMATE in leveraging limited labeled data, achieving stable metrics across\nall sleep stages, and reaching 90% accuracy in its supervised form. Comparative\nanalyses reveal SMATE's superior performance over TapNet and HMM, while XCM\nexcels in supervised scenarios with an accuracy range of 92 - 94%. These\nfindings underscore the potential of semi-supervised models in early AD\ndetection, particularly in overcoming the challenges associated with the\nscarcity of labeled data. Ablation tests affirm the critical role of\nspatio-temporal feature extraction in semi-supervised predictive performance,\nand t-SNE visualizations validate the model's proficiency in distinguishing AD\npatterns. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of AD detection\nthrough innovative Deep Learning approaches, highlighting the crucial role of\nsemi-supervised learning in addressing data limitations.",

In this regard, a novel\nhybrid FME-Residual-HSCMT technique is introduced, comprised of residual CNN\nand Transformer concepts to capture global and local fine-grained AD analysis\nin MRI. This approach integrates three distinct elements: a novel CNN Meet\nTransformer (HSCMT), customized residual learning CNN, and a new Feature Map\nEnhancement (FME) strategy to learn diverse morphological, contrast, and\ntexture variations of ADs. The proposed HSCMT at the initial stage utilizes\nstem convolution blocks that are integrated with CMT blocks followed by\nsystematic homogenous and structural (HS) operations. The customized CMT block\nencapsulates each element with global contextual interactions through\nmulti-head attention and facilitates computational efficiency through\nlightweight. Moreover, inverse residual and stem CNN in customized CMT enables\neffective extraction of local texture information and handling vanishing\ngradients. Furthermore, in the FME strategy, residual CNN blocks utilize\nTL-based generated auxiliary and are combined with the proposed HSCMT channels\nat the target level to achieve diverse enriched feature space. Finally, diverse\nenhanced channels are fed into a novel spatial attention mechanism for optimal\npixel selection to reduce redundancy and discriminate minor contrast and\ntexture inter-class variation. The proposed achieves an F1-score (98.55%), an\naccuracy of 98.42% and a sensitivity of 98.50%, a precision of 98.60% on the\nstandard Kaggle dataset, and demonstrates outperformance existing ViTs and CNNs\nmethods.",

        "summary": "Deep learning (DL) models have shown significant potential in Alzheimer's\nDisease (AD) classification. However, understanding and interpreting these\nmodels remains challenging, which hinders the adoption of these models in\nclinical practice. Techniques such as saliency maps have been proven effective\nin providing visual and empirical clues about how these models work, but there\nstill remains a gap in understanding which specific brain regions DL models\nfocus on and whether these brain regions are pathologically associated with AD.\n  To bridge such gap, in this study, we developed a quantitative\ndisease-focusing strategy to first enhance the interpretability of DL models\nusing saliency maps and brain segmentations; then we propose a disease-focus\n(DF) score that quantifies how much a DL model focuses on brain areas relevant\nto AD pathology based on clinically known MRI-based pathological regions of AD.\nUsing this strategy, we compared several state-of-the-art DL models, including\na baseline 3D ResNet model, a pretrained MedicalNet model, and a MedicalNet\nwith data augmentation to classify patients with AD vs. cognitive normal\npatients using MRI data; then we evaluated these models in terms of their\nabilities to focus on disease-relevant regions. Our results show interesting\ndisease-focusing patterns with different models, particularly characteristic\npatterns with the pretrained models and data augmentation, and also provide\ninsight into their classification performance. These results suggest that the\napproach we developed for quantitatively assessing the abilities of DL models\nto focus on disease-relevant regions may help improve interpretability of these\nmodels for AD classification and facilitate their adoption for AD diagnosis in\nclinical practice.

To train VisTA, we used a constructed reference dataset\ncontaining images, abnormality types, and descriptions verified by medical\nexperts. VisTA produces four outputs: predicted abnormality type, similarity to\nreference cases, evidence-driven explanation, and final AD diagnoses. To\nillustrate VisTA's efficacy, we reported accuracy metrics for abnormality\nretrieval and dementia prediction. To demonstrate VisTA's explainability, we\ncompared its explanations with human experts' explanations.\n  Results: Compared to 15 million images used for baseline pretraining, VisTA\nonly used 170 samples for fine-tuning and obtained significant improvement in\nabnormality retrieval and dementia prediction. For abnormality retrieval, VisTA\nreached 74% accuracy and an AUC of 0.87 (26% and 0.74, respectively, from\nbaseline models). For dementia prediction, VisTA achieved 88% accuracy and an\nAUC of 0.82 (30% and 0.57, respectively, from baseline models).

        "title": "DECT: Harnessing LLM-assisted Fine-Grained Linguistic Knowledge and\n  Label-Switched and Label-Preserved Data Generation for Diagnosis of\n  Alzheimer's Disease",
        "summary": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease\naffecting 50 million people worldwide. Low-cost, accurate identification of key\nmarkers of AD is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention. Language\nimpairment is one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline, which can be used\nto discriminate AD patients from normal control individuals.\nPatient-interviewer dialogues may be used to detect such impairments, but they\nare often mixed with ambiguous, noisy, and irrelevant information, making the\nAD detection task difficult. Moreover, the limited availability of AD speech\nsamples and variability in their speech styles pose significant challenges in\ndeveloping robust speech-based AD detection models. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DECT, a novel speech-based domain-specific approach\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) for fine-grained linguistic analysis\nand label-switched label-preserved data generation. Our study presents four\nnovelties: We harness the summarizing capabilities of LLMs to identify and\ndistill key Cognitive-Linguistic information from noisy speech transcripts,\neffectively filtering irrelevant information. We leverage the inherent\nlinguistic knowledge of LLMs to extract linguistic markers from unstructured\nand heterogeneous audio transcripts. We exploit the compositional ability of\nLLMs to generate AD speech transcripts consisting of diverse linguistic\npatterns to overcome the speech data scarcity challenge and enhance the\nrobustness of AD detection models. We use the augmented AD textual speech\ntranscript dataset and a more fine-grained representation of AD textual speech\ntranscript data to fine-tune the AD detection model. The results have shown\nthat DECT demonstrates superior model performance with an 11% improvement in AD\ndetection accuracy on the datasets from DementiaBank compared to the baselines.",

        "title": "CQ CNN: A Hybrid Classical Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for\n  Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Diffusion Generated and U Net Segmented\n  3D MRI",
        "summary": "The detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) from clinical MRI data is an active\narea of research in medical imaging. Recent advances in quantum computing,\nparticularly the integration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with\nclassical machine learning architectures, offer new opportunities to develop\nmodels that may outperform traditional methods. However, quantum machine\nlearning (QML) remains in its early stages and requires further experimental\nanalysis to better understand its behavior and limitations. In this paper, we\npropose an end to end hybrid classical quantum convolutional neural network (CQ\nCNN) for AD detection using clinically formatted 3D MRI data. Our approach\ninvolves developing a framework to make 3D MRI data usable for machine\nlearning, designing and training a brain tissue segmentation model (Skull Net),\nand training a diffusion model to generate synthetic images for the minority\nclass. Our converged models exhibit potential quantum advantages, achieving\nhigher accuracy in fewer epochs than classical models. The proposed beta8 3\nqubit model achieves an accuracy of 97.50%, surpassing state of the art (SOTA)\nmodels while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. In\nparticular, the architecture employs only 13K parameters (0.48 MB), reducing\nthe parameter count by more than 99.99% compared to current SOTA models.\nFurthermore, the diffusion-generated data used to train our quantum models, in\nconjunction with real samples, preserve clinical structural standards,\nrepresenting a notable first in the field of QML. We conclude that CQCNN\narchitecture like models, with further improvements in gradient optimization\ntechniques, could become a viable option and even a potential alternative to\nclassical models for AD detection, especially in data limited and resource\nconstrained clinical settings.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative condition that affects\nmillions around the world. As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis\nprocedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron\nemission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural\nmagnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient\nsolution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have\nfacilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD\npathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains\nchallenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a\nresult, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid\npositivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other\nhand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid\npositivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid\npositive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard\ntests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation. Inspired by the recent\nsuccess of transformer architectures, we propose a geometric deep learning\nmodel based on transformer that is both scalable and robust to variations in\ninput volumetric mesh size. Our work introduced a novel tokenization scheme for\ntetrahedral meshes, incorporating anatomical landmarks generated by a\npre-trained Gaussian process model. Our model achieved superior classification\nperformance in AD classification task. In addition, we showed that the model\nwas also generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity prediction with\nindividuals in the medium risk class, where BM alone cannot achieve a clear\nclassification. Our work may enrich geometric deep learning research and\nimprove AD diagnosis accuracy without using expensive and invasive PET scans.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with neural,\ngenetic, and proteomic factors while affecting multiple cognitive and\nbehavioral faculties. Traditional AD prediction largely focuses on univariate\ndisease outcomes, such as disease stages and severity. Multimodal data encode\nbroader disease information than a single modality and may, therefore, improve\ndisease prediction; but they often contain missing values. Recent \"deeper\"\nmachine learning approaches show promise in improving prediction accuracy, yet\nthe biological relevance of these models needs to be further charted.\nIntegrating missing data analysis, predictive modeling, multimodal data\nanalysis, and explainable AI, we propose OPTIMUS, a predictive, modular, and\nexplainable machine learning framework, to unveil the many-to-many predictive\npathways between multimodal input data and multivariate disease outcomes amidst\nmissing values. OPTIMUS first applies modality-specific imputation to uncover\ndata from each modality while optimizing overall prediction accuracy. It then\nmaps multimodal biomarkers to multivariate outcomes using machine-learning and\nextracts biomarkers respectively predictive of each outcome. Finally, OPTIMUS\nincorporates XAI to explain the identified multimodal biomarkers. Using data\nfrom 346 cognitively normal subjects, 608 persons with mild cognitive\nimpairment, and 251 AD patients, OPTIMUS identifies neural and transcriptomic\nsignatures that jointly but differentially predict multivariate outcomes\nrelated to executive function, language, memory, and visuospatial function. Our\nwork demonstrates the potential of building a predictive and biologically\nexplainable machine-learning framework to uncover multimodal biomarkers that\ncapture disease profiles across varying cognitive landscapes.

        "summary": "The use of amyloid-beta (A$\\beta$) clearance to support regulatory approvals\nof drugs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains controversial. We evaluate\nA$\\beta$ as a potential trial-level surrogate endpoint for clinical function in\nAD using a meta-analysis. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting data on\nthe effectiveness of anti- A$\\beta$ monoclonal antibodies (MABs) on A$\\beta$\nand clinical outcomes were identified through a literature review. A Bayesian\nbivariate meta-analysis was used to evaluate surrogate relationships between\nthe treatment effects on A$\\beta$ and clinical function, with the intercept,\nslope and variance quantifying the trial level association. The analysis was\nperformed using RCT data both collectively across all MABs and separately for\neach MAB through subgroup analysis. The latter analysis was extended by\napplying Bayesian hierarchical models to borrow information across treatments.\nWe identified 23 RCTs with 39 treatment contrasts for seven MABs. The\nassociation between treatment effects on A$\\beta$ and Clinical Dementia Rating\n- Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) across all MABs was strong: with intercept of -0.03\n(95% credible intervals: -0.16, 0.11), slope of 1.41 (0.60, 2.21) and variance\nof 0.02 (0.00, 0.05). For individual treatments, the surrogate relationships\nwere suboptimal, displaying large uncertainty. The use of hierarchical models\nconsiderably reduced the uncertainty around key parameters, narrowing the\nintervals for the slopes by an average of 71% (range: 51%-95%) and for the\nvariances by 28% (7%-65%). Our results suggest that A$\\beta$ is a potential\nsurrogate endpoint for CDR-SOB when assuming a common surrogate relationship\nacross all MABs. When allowing for information-sharing, the surrogate\nrelationships improved, but only for lecanemab and aducanumab was the\nimprovement sufficient to support a surrogate relationship.",

        "summary": "This study introduces Reverse-Speech-Finder (RSF), a groundbreaking neural\nnetwork backtracking architecture designed to enhance Alzheimer's Disease (AD)\ndiagnosis through speech analysis. Leveraging the power of pre-trained large\nlanguage models, RSF identifies and utilizes the most probable AD-specific\nspeech markers, addressing both the scarcity of real AD speech samples and the\nchallenge of limited interpretability in existing models. RSF's unique approach\nconsists of three core innovations: Firstly, it exploits the observation that\nspeech markers most probable of predicting AD, defined as the most probable\nspeech-markers (MPMs), must have the highest probability of activating those\nneurons (in the neural network) with the highest probability of predicting AD,\ndefined as the most probable neurons (MPNs). Secondly, it utilizes a speech\ntoken representation at the input layer, allowing backtracking from MPNs to\nidentify the most probable speech-tokens (MPTs) of AD. Lastly, it develops an\ninnovative backtracking method to track backwards from the MPNs to the input\nlayer, identifying the MPTs and the corresponding MPMs, and ingeniously\nuncovering novel speech markers for AD detection. Experimental results\ndemonstrate RSF's superiority over traditional methods such as SHAP and\nIntegrated Gradients, achieving a 3.5% improvement in accuracy and a 3.2% boost\nin F1-score. By generating speech data that encapsulates novel markers, RSF not\nonly mitigates the limitations of real data scarcity but also significantly\nenhances the robustness and accuracy of AD diagnostic models. These findings\nunderscore RSF's potential as a transformative tool in speech-based AD\ndetection, offering new insights into AD-related linguistic deficits and paving\nthe way for more effective non-invasive early intervention strategies.",

While existing approaches primarily focus\non forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive\nvalue of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive\ndecline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that\njointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at\nMonth 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and\nMonth 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those\nassociated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,\nan aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer\n(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are\nfused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our\nresults show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score\nprediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1\n(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently\ndominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential\nsub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.\nFurther analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,\nwhere the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more\ncomplex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved\nmultimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced\nlearning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and\nprovides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD\nprediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)",

Section 2 briefly describes the\nstandard neural-network techniques which are able to learn well-suited\nclassification modes from data presented by relevant features. Section 3\nintroduces an evolving cascade neural network technique which adds new input\nnodes as well as new neurons to the network while the training error decreases.\nThis algorithm is applied to recognize artifacts in the clinical EEGs. Section\n4 presents the GMDH-type polynomial networks learnt from data. We applied this\ntechnique to distinguish the EEGs recorded from an Alzheimer and a healthy\npatient as well as recognize EEG artifacts. Section 5 describes the new\nneural-network technique developed to induce multi-class concepts from data.

        "summary": "The determination of the folding mechanisms of proteins is critical to\nunderstand the topological change that can propagate Alzheimer and\nCreutzfeld-Jakobs diseases, among others. The computational community has paid\nconsiderable attention to this problem; however, the associated time scale,\ntypically on the order of milliseconds or more, represents a formidable\nchallenge. Ab initio protein folding from long molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations or ensemble dynamics is not feasible with ordinary computing\nfacilities and new techniques must be introduced. Here we present a detailed\nstudy of the folding of a 16-residue beta-hairpin, described by a generic\nenergy model and using the activation-relaxation technique. From a total of 90\ntrajectories at 300 K, three folding pathways emerge. All involve a\nsimultaneous optimization of the complete hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding\ninteractions. The first two follow closely those observed by previous\ntheoretical studies. The third pathway, never observed by previous all-atom\nfolding, unfolding and equilibrium simulations, can be described as a reptation\nmove of one strand of the beta-sheet with respect to the other. This reptation\nmove indicates that non-native interactions can play a dominant role in the\nfolding of secondary structures. These results point to a more complex folding\npicture than expected for a simple beta-hairpin.",

This process has received much attention\nbecause disordered oligomeric aggregates have been associated with\nneurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here\nwe describe a self-templated nucleation mechanism that determines the\ntransition between the initial condensation of polypeptide chains into\ndisordered assemblies and their reordering into fibrillar structures.

        "summary": "To achieve sparse parametrizations that allows intuitive analysis, we aim to\nrepresent deformation with a basis containing interpretable elements, and we\nwish to use elements that have the description capacity to represent the\ndeformation compactly. To accomplish this, we introduce in this paper\nhigher-order momentum distributions in the LDDMM registration framework. While\nthe zeroth order moments previously used in LDDMM only describe local\ndisplacement, the first-order momenta that are proposed here represent a basis\nthat allows local description of affine transformations and subsequent compact\ndescription of non-translational movement in a globally non-rigid deformation.\nThe resulting representation contains directly interpretable information from\nboth mathematical and modeling perspectives. We develop the mathematical\nconstruction of the registration framework with higher-order momenta, we show\nthe implications for sparse image registration and deformation description, and\nwe provide examples of how the parametrization enables registration with a very\nlow number of parameters. The capacity and interpretability of the\nparametrization using higher-order momenta lead to natural modeling of\narticulated movement, and the method promises to be useful for quantifying\nventricle expansion and progressing atrophy during Alzheimer's disease.",

Instead, clinicians will typically find patients that cannot be\nclassified as having clearly progressed into the disease state. For those\nsubjects, very little can be said about their brain function on the basis of\nanalyses of group differences. To describe the intermediate brain function\nrequires models that interpolate between the disease states. We have chosen\nGaussian Processes (GP) regression to obtain a continuous spectrum of brain\nactivation and to extract the unknown disease progression profile. Our models\nincorporate spatial distribution of measures of activation, e.g. the\ncorrelation of an fMRI trace with an input stimulus, and so constitute\nultra-high multi-variate GP regressors. We applied GPs to model fMRI image\nphenotypes across Alzheimer's Disease (AD) behavioural measures, e.g. MMSE, ACE\netc. scores, and obtained predictions at non-observed MMSE/ACE values. The\noverall model confirmed the known reduction in the spatial extent of activity\nin response to reading versus false-font stimulation. The predictive\nuncertainty indicated the worsening confidence intervals at behavioural scores\ndistance from those used for GP training. Thus, the model indicated the type of\npatient (what behavioural score) that would need to included in the training\ndata to improve models predictions.",

We show that, in scale-free networks with divergent second\nmoment of degree distribution, an influence of noise on neuronal activity is\nstrongly enhanced in comparison with networks with a finite second moment. A\nvery small noise level can stimulate spontaneous activity of a finite fraction\nof neurons and sustained network oscillations.

A\nrandom removal of neurons leads to gradual decrease of frequency of network\noscillations similar to the slowing-down of the alpha rhythm in Alzheimer's\ndisease. However, the networks are vulnerable to targeted attacks. A removal of\na few excitatory or inhibitory hubs can impair sustained network oscillations.",

        "summary": "The mechanisms underlying major aspects of the human brain remain a mystery.\nIt is unknown how verbal episodic memory is formed and integrated with sensory\nepisodic memory. There is no consensus on the function and nature of dreaming.\nHere we present a theory for governing neural activity in the human brain. The\ntheory describes the mechanisms for building memory traces for entities and\nexplains how verbal memory is integrated with sensory memory. We infer that a\ncore function of dreaming is to move charged particles such as calcium ions\nfrom the hippocampus to association areas to primary areas. We link a high\nlevel of calcium ions concentrations to Alzheimer's disease. We present a more\nprecise definition of consciousness. Our results are a step forward in\nunderstanding the function and health of the human brain and provide the public\nwith ways to keep a healthy brain.",

        "summary": "Binary classification is a common statistical learning problem in which a\nmodel is estimated on a set of covariates for some outcome indicating the\nmembership of one of two classes. In the literature, there exists a distinction\nbetween hard and soft classification. In soft classification, the conditional\nclass probability is modeled as a function of the covariates. In contrast, hard\nclassification methods only target the optimal prediction boundary. While hard\nand soft classification methods have been studied extensively, not much work\nhas been done to compare the actual tasks of hard and soft classification. In\nthis paper we propose a spectrum of statistical learning problems which span\nthe hard and soft classification tasks based on fitting multiple decision rules\nto the data. By doing so, we reveal a novel collection of learning tasks of\nincreasing complexity. We study the problems using the framework of\nlarge-margin classifiers and a class of piecewise linear convex surrogates, for\nwhich we derive statistical properties and a corresponding sub-gradient descent\nalgorithm.

Mainly, through the\ncritical transmission delay makes chaotic oscillators be coupled on the edge of\nstability, we find that the transition of synchronizing path is\n\\emph{abnormal}, which is characterized by the following evidences: (a)\nsynchronization process starts with low-degree rather than high-degree ones;\n(b) the high-degree nodes don't undertake the role of hub; (c) the synchronized\nsubnetworks show a poor small-world property as a result of hubs absence; (d)\nthe clustering synchronization behavior emerges even community structure is\nabsent in the scale-free network. This abnormal synchronizing path suggests\nthat the diverse synchronization behaviors occur in the same topology, which\nimplies that the relationship between dynamics and structure of network is much\nmore complicated than the common sense that the structure is the foundation of\ndynamics.

        "summary": "Neuroimage analysis usually involves learning thousands or even millions of\nvariables using only a limited number of samples. In this regard, sparse\nmodels, e.g. the lasso, are applied to select the optimal features and achieve\nhigh diagnosis accuracy. The lasso, however, usually results in independent\nunstable features. Stability, a manifest of reproducibility of statistical\nresults subject to reasonable perturbations to data and the model, is an\nimportant focus in statistics, especially in the analysis of high dimensional\ndata. In this paper, we explore a nonnegative generalized fused lasso model for\nstable feature selection in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition\nto sparsity, our model incorporates two important pathological priors: the\nspatial cohesion of lesion voxels and the positive correlation between the\nfeatures and the disease labels. To optimize the model, we propose an efficient\nalgorithm by proving a novel link between total variation and fast network flow\nalgorithms via conic duality. Experiments show that the proposed nonnegative\nmodel performs much better in exploring the intrinsic structure of data via\nselecting stable features compared with other state-of-the-arts.",

        "summary": "Hardy and Higgins first proposed the amyloid cascade hypothesis in 1992,\nstating that the decrease in neuronal function observed in Alzheimer's Disease\n(AD) is due to a process initiated by the oligomerization of amyloid-beta\npeptides. One hypothesis states that toxicity arises from the aggregation of\namyloid-beta into a pore structure, which can then puncture the brain cell\nmembrane; this allow toxic calcium ions to flood through the opening, causing\neventual cell death. In 2007, neurobiologist Ruth Nussinov calculated the three\npore sizes most likely to occur within the brain. Based on her findings, we\nconstructed a method to determine the time it takes for a cell to die after the\ncell is punctured by the pore. Our findings have shown that cell death occurs\nwithin one second after the oligomer makes contact with the cell. We believe\nthis is important because instant cell death has been one criticism of\nNussinov's model, and we have calculated a concrete time value for that\ncriticism. We identify two potential deficiencies with our model that could be\nimproved: first, we treat the calcium as an ideal gas, which it is not; second,\nwe assume that the pores are static (i.e. constantly open), while recent\ndevelopments suggest that they may open and close dynamically.",

Diffusion weighted MRI imaging has allowed researchers to\nnon-invasively estimate a network of structural cortical connections made by\nwhite matter tracts, but current statistical methods for relating such networks\nto the presence or absence of a disease cannot exploit this rich network\ninformation. Standard practice considers each edge independently or summarizes\nthe network with a few simple features. We enable dramatic gains in biological\ninsight via a novel unifying methodology for inference on brain network\nvariations associated to the occurrence of neurological diseases. The key of\nthis approach is to define a probabilistic generative mechanism directly on the\nspace of network configurations via dependent mixtures of low-rank\nfactorizations, which efficiently exploit network information and allow the\nprobability mass function for the brain network-valued random variable to vary\nflexibly across the group of patients characterized by a specific neurological\ndisease and the one comprising age-matched cognitively healthy individuals.",

The use of\nCRISTAL has provided a rich environment for neuroscientists to track and manage\nthe evolution of data and workflow usage over time in neuGRID and N4U.",

        "summary": "Over the past few decades, magnetic resonance imaging has been utilized as a\npowerful imaging modality to evaluate the structure and function of various\norgans in the human body,such as the brain. Additionally, diffusion and\nperfusion MR imaging have been increasingly used in neurovascular clinical\napplications. In diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, the mobility of\nwater molecules is explored in order to obtain information about the\nmicroscopic behavior of the tissues. In contrast, perfusion weighted imaging\nuses tracers to exploit hemodynamic status, which enables researchers and\nclinicians to consider this imaging modality as an early biomarker of certain\nbrain diseases. In this review, the fundamentals of physics for diffusion and\nperfusion MR imaging both of which are highly sensitive to microenvironmental\nalterations at the cellular level as well as their application in the treatment\nof aging, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors and cerebral ischemic injury were\ndiscussed.",

AD is believed to\noccur as a result of the misfolding and aggregation of A\\b{eta}. The\ndyshomeostasis of metal ions and their propensity to interact with A\\b{eta} has\nalso been implicated in AD. In this work, we use single molecule atomic force\nspectroscopy to measure the rupture force required to dissociate two A\\b{eta}\n(1 42) peptides in the presence of copper ions, Cu2+. In addition, we use\natomic force microscopy to resolve the aggregation of A\\b{eta} formed. Previous\nresearch has shown that metal ions decrease the lag time associated with\nA\\b{eta} aggregation. We show that with the addition of copper ions the\nunbinding force increases notably. This suggests that the reduction of lag time\nassociated with A\\b{eta} aggregation occurs on a single molecule level as a\nresult of an increase in binding forces during the very initial interactions\nbetween two A\\b{eta} peptides.

        "summary": "Intraneural accumulation of misfolded proteins is a common feature of several\nneurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,\nand Familial Encephalopathy with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies (FENIB). FENIB is\na rare disease due to a point mutation in neuroserpin which accelerates protein\naggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here we show that cholesterol\ndepletion induced either by prolonged exposure to statins or by inhibiting the\nsterol regulatory binding-element protein (SREBP) pathway also enhances\naggregation of neuroserpin proteins. These findings can be explained\nconsidering a computational model of protein aggregation under non-equilibrium\nconditions, where a decrease in the rate of protein clearance improves\naggregation. Decreasing cholesterol in cell membranes affects their biophysical\nproperties, including their ability to form the vesicles needed for protein\nclearance, as we illustrate by a simple mathematical model. Taken together,\nthese results suggest that cholesterol reduction induces neuroserpin\naggregation, even in absence of specific neuroserpin mutations. The new\nmechanism we uncover could be relevant also for other neurodegenerative\ndiseases associated with protein aggregation.",

However, we observe that there exists another type of features\nintroduced during the preprocessing steps and we call them \"\\textbf{Procedural\nBias}\". Besides, such bias can be leveraged to improve classification accuracy.\nNevertheless, most existing models suffer from either under-fit without\nconsidering procedural bias or poor interpretability without differentiating\nsuch bias from lesion ones. In this paper, a novel dual-task algorithm namely\n\\emph{GSplit LBI} is proposed to resolve this problem. By introducing an\naugmented variable enforced to be structural sparsity with a variable splitting\nterm, the estimators for prediction and selecting lesion features can be\noptimized separately and mutually monitored by each other following an\niterative scheme. Empirical experiments have been evaluated on the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative\\thinspace(ADNI) database.

We try to find\nanswers for fundamental questions (Why water is so important for life? Which\nproperties make water unique for biological processes?) and applications (Can\nwe design better drugs? Can we limit protein- aggregations causing Alzheimer?\nHow to implement nanotheranostic?). Here we focus only on the two larger scales\nof our approach: (i) The coarse-grain description of hydrated proteins and\nprotein folding at sub-nanometric length-scale and milliseconds-to-seconds\ntime-scales, and (ii) the coarse-grain modeling of protein self-assembly on\nnanoparticles at 10-to-100 nm length-scale and seconds-to-hours time-scales.",

        "summary": "The mechanisms behind waste clearance from deep within the parenchyma of the\nbrain remain unclear to this date. Experimental evidence has shown that one\npathway for waste clearance, termed intramural periarterial drainage (IPAD), is\nthe rapid drainage of interstitial fluid (ISF) via basement membranes (BM) of\nthe smooth muscle cells (SMC) of cerebral arteries and its failure is closely\nassociated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously\nshown that arterial pulsations from the heart beat are not strong enough to\ndrive waste clearance. Here we demonstrate computational evidence for a\nmechanism for cerebral waste clearance that is driven by functional hyperaemia,\nthat is, the dilation of cerebral arteries as a consequence of increased\nneuronal demand. This mechanism is based on our model for fluid flow through\nthe vascular basement membrane. It accounts for waste clearance rates observed\nin mouse experiments and aligns with pathological observations as well as\nrecommendations to lower the individual risk of AD, such as keeping mentally\nand physically active.",

While calcium influx through NMDA-R\nplays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, experimental evidence indicates\nthat NMDAR-mediated calcium influx also modifies neuronal excitability through\nthe activation of calcium-activated potassium channels. This mechanism has not\nyet been studied theoretically. Our theoretical model provides a simple\ndescription of neuronal electrical activity that takes into account the tonic\nactivity of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors and a cytosolic calcium compartment.\nWe show that calcium influx mediated by the tonic activity of NMDA-R can be\ncoupled directly to the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels,\nresulting in an overall inhibitory effect on neuronal excitability.\nFurthermore, the presence of tonic NMDA-R activity promotes bistability in\nelectrical activity by dramatically increasing the stimulus interval where both\na stable steady state and repetitive firing can coexist. These results could\nprovide an intrinsic mechanism for the constitution of memory traces in\nneuronal circuits.

        "summary": "Brain surface analysis is essential to neuroscience, however, the complex\ngeometry of the brain cortex hinders computational methods for this task. The\ndifficulty arises from a discrepancy between 3D imaging data, which is\nrepresented in Euclidean space, and the non-Euclidean geometry of the\nhighly-convoluted brain surface. Recent advances in machine learning have\nenabled the use of neural networks for non-Euclidean spaces. These facilitate\nthe learning of surface data, yet pooling strategies often remain constrained\nto a single fixed-graph. This paper proposes a new learnable graph pooling\nmethod for processing multiple surface-valued data to output subject-based\ninformation. The proposed method innovates by learning an intrinsic aggregation\nof graph nodes based on graph spectral embedding. We illustrate the advantages\nof our approach with in-depth experiments on two large-scale benchmark\ndatasets. The flexibility of the pooling strategy is evaluated on four\ndifferent prediction tasks, namely, subject-sex classification, regression of\ncortical region sizes, classification of Alzheimer's disease stages, and brain\nage regression.

In LC, the older cohort exhibited a\nsignificant reduction in mean and radial diffusivity, but a significant\nincrease in fractional anisotropy compared to the young cohort.

        "summary": "People with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) often show the\nproblem of repetitive questioning, which brings a great burden on persons with\nADRD (PwDs) and their caregivers. Conversational robots hold promise of coping\nwith this problem and hence alleviating the burdens on caregivers. In this\npaper, we proposed a partially observable markov decision process (POMDP) model\nfor the PwD-robot interaction in the context of repetitive questioning, and\nused Q-learning to learn an adaptive conversation strategy (i.e., rate of\nfollow-up question and difficulty of follow-up question) towards PwDs with\ndifferent cognitive capabilities and different engagement levels. The results\nindicated that Q-learning was helpful for action selection for the robot. This\nmay be a useful step towards the application of conversational social robots to\ncope with repetitive questioning in PwDs.",

The resulting kinetostatic control torque inputs will be\nclose to the KCM-based reference vector field and guaranteed to be constrained\nby a predetermined bound; hence, high-entropy-loss routes during folding are\navoided while the energy of the molecule is decreased.",

Seventy percent of cases are due to\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and there is a 10-20 year 'pre-clinical'\nperiod before significant cognitive decline occurs. We urgently need, cost\neffective, objective methods to detect AD, and other dementias, at an early\nstage.

Currently, detection of dementia is largely by pen and paper\ncognitive tests but these are time consuming and insensitive to pre-clinical\nphases. Specialist brain scans and body fluid biomarkers can detect the\nearliest stages of dementia but are too invasive or expensive for widespread\nuse.

Recent deep\nlearning models have exploited speech pauses to achieve highly accurate\ndementia detection, but have not exploited the interpretability of speech\npauses, i.e., what and how positions and lengths of speech pauses affect the\nresult of dementia detection. In this paper, we will study the positions and\nlengths of dementia-sensitive pauses using adversarial learning approaches.\nSpecifically, we first utilize an adversarial attack approach by adding the\nperturbation to the speech pauses of the testing samples, aiming to reduce the\nconfidence levels of the detection model. Then, we apply an adversarial\ntraining approach to evaluate the impact of the perturbation in training\nsamples on the detection model. We examine the interpretability from the\nperspectives of model accuracy, pause context, and pause length. We found that\nsome pauses are more sensitive to dementia than other pauses from the model's\nperspective, e.g., speech pauses near to the verb \"is\". Increasing lengths of\nsensitive pauses or adding sensitive pauses leads the model inference to\nAlzheimer's Disease, while decreasing the lengths of sensitive pauses or\ndeleting sensitive pauses leads to non-AD.",

Further, the thresholds detect\nsignificant differences between shape and shape-colour binding tasks when these\nare tested in the left side of the display screen, but no such differences are\ndetected when these tasks are tested for in the right side of the display\nscreen.

Motivated by applications to neuroimaging and genetics data, and\nfollowing the succes of shrinkage and kernel methods for prediction with\nhigh-dimensional data, we here introduce the adaptive Mantel test as an\nextension of the MT. By utilizing kernels and penalized similarity measures,\nthe adaptive Mantel test is able to achieve higher statistical power relative\nto the classical MT in many settings. Furthermore, the adaptive Mantel test is\ndesigned to simultaneously test over multiple similarity measures such that the\ncorrect type I error rate under the null hypothesis is maintained without the\nneed to directly adjust the significance threshold for multiple testing. The\nperformance of the adaptive Mantel test is evaluated on simulated data, and is\nused to investigate associations between genetics markers related to\nAlzheimer's Disease and heatlhy brain physiology with data from a working\nmemory study of 350 college students from Beijing Normal University.",

Here, we will focus on the graph\ncomparison problem. Although different estimates exist to quantify how\ndifferent two networks are, an appropriate metric has not been proposed. Within\nthis framework we compare the performances of different networks distances (a\ntopological descriptor and a kernel-based approach) with the simple Euclidean\nmetric. We define the performance of metrics as the efficiency of distinguish\ntwo network's groups and the computing time. We evaluate these frameworks on\nsynthetic and real-world networks (functional connectomes from Alzheimer\npatients and healthy subjects), and we show that the Euclidean distance is the\none that efficiently captures networks differences in comparison to other\nproposals. We conclude that the operational use of complicated methods can be\njustified only by showing that they out-perform well-understood traditional\nstatistics, such as Euclidean metrics.",

        "summary": "Understanding the complexity of biological neural networks like the human\nbrain is one of the scientific challenges of our century. The organization of\nthe brain can be described at different levels, ranging from small neural\nnetworks to entire brain regions. Existing methods for the description of\nfunctionally or effective connectivity are based on the analysis of relations\nbetween the activities of different neural units by detecting correlations or\ninformation flow. This is a crucial step in understanding neural disorders like\nAlzheimers disease and their causative factors. To evaluate these estimation\nmethods, it is necessary to refer to a neural network with known connectivity,\nwhich is typically unknown for natural biological neural networks. Therefore,\nnetwork simulations, also in silico, are available. In this work, the in silico\nsimulation of large scale neural networks is established and the influence of\ndifferent topologies on the generated patterns of neuronal signals is\ninvestigated. The goal is to develop standard evaluation methods for\nneurocomputational algorithms with a realistic large scale model to enable\nbenchmarking and comparability of different studies.",

Using this regularized OT approach, we can incorporate diffusion, handle\nnoise, and accurately capture and visualize the time varying dynamics in GS\ntransport. Moreover, we are able to reduce the registration mean-squared and\ninfinity-norm error across time points by up to a factor of 5 as compared to\nthe current state-of-the-art method.

        "summary": "Liquid cellular compartments spatially segregate from the cytoplasm and can\nregulate aberrant protein aggregation, a process linked to several medical\nconditions, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Yet the mechanisms\nby which these droplet-like compartments affect protein aggregation remain\nunknown. Here, we combine kinetic theory of protein aggregation and\nliquid-liquid phase separation to study the spatial control of irreversible\nprotein aggregation in the presence of liquid compartments. We find that, even\nfor weak interactions between the compartment constituents and the aggregating\nmonomers, aggregates are strongly enriched inside the liquid compartment\nrelative to the surrounding cytoplasm. We show that this enrichment is caused\nby a positive feedback mechanism of aggregate nucleation and growth which is\nmediated by a flux maintaining the phase equilibrium between the compartment\nand the cytoplasm. Our model predicts that the compartment volume that\nmaximizes aggregate enrichment in the compartment is determined by the reaction\norders of aggregate nucleation. The underlying mechanism of aggregate\nenrichment could be used to confine cytotoxic protein aggregates inside\ndroplet-like compartments suggesting potential new avenues against aberrant\nprotein aggregation. Our findings could also represent a common mechanism for\nthe spatial control of irreversible chemical reactions in general.",

        "summary": "An effective approach to isolation of sub-micro sized particles is desired to\nseparate cancer and healthy cells or in therapy of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's\ndisease. However, since bioparticles span a large size range comprising several\norders of magnitude, development of an adequate separation method is a\nchallenging task. We consider a collection of non-interacting Brownian\nparticles of various sizes moving in a symmetric periodic potential and\nsubjected to an external unbiased harmonic driving as well as a constant bias.\nWe reveal a nonintuitive, yet efficient, separation mechanism based on thermal\nfluctuations induced negative mobility phenomenon in which particles of a given\nsize move in a direction opposite to the applied bias. By changing solely\ntemperature of the system one can separate particles of various strictly\ndefined sizes. This novel approach may be important step towards development of\npoint-of-care lab-on-a-chip devices.",

        "title": "Automatic Reminiscence Therapy for Dementia",
        "summary": "With people living longer than ever, the number of cases with dementia such\nas Alzheimer's disease increases steadily. It affects more than 46 million\npeople worldwide, and it is estimated that in 2050 more than 100 million will\nbe affected. While there are not effective treatments for these terminal\ndiseases, therapies such as reminiscence, that stimulate memories from the past\nare recommended. Currently, reminiscence therapy takes place in care homes and\nis guided by a therapist or a carer. In this work, we present an AI-based\nsolution to automatize the reminiscence therapy, which consists in a dialogue\nsystem that uses photos as input to generate questions. We run a usability case\nstudy with patients diagnosed of mild cognitive impairment that shows they\nfound the system very entertaining and challenging. Overall, this paper\npresents how reminiscence therapy can be automatized by using machine learning,\nand deployed to smartphones and laptops, making the therapy more accessible to\nevery person affected by dementia.",

        "summary": "Depression detection research has increased over the last few decades, one\nmajor bottleneck of which is the limited data availability and representation\nlearning. Recently, self-supervised learning has seen success in pretraining\ntext embeddings and has been applied broadly on related tasks with sparse data,\nwhile pretrained audio embeddings based on self-supervised learning are rarely\ninvestigated. This paper proposes DEPA, a self-supervised, pretrained\ndepression audio embedding method for depression detection. An encoder-decoder\nnetwork is used to extract DEPA on in-domain depressed datasets (DAIC and MDD)\nand out-domain (Switchboard, Alzheimer's) datasets. With DEPA as the audio\nembedding extracted at response-level, a significant performance gain is\nachieved on downstream tasks, evaluated on both sparse datasets like DAIC and\nlarge major depression disorder dataset (MDD). This paper not only exhibits\nitself as a novel embedding extracting method capturing response-level\nrepresentation for depression detection but more significantly, is an\nexploration of self-supervised learning in a specific task within audio\nprocessing.",

        "summary": "Many cellular processes rely on the cell's ability to transport material to\nand from the nucleus. Networks consisting of many microtubules and actin\nfilaments are key to this transport. Recently, the inhibition of intracellular\ntransport has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's\ndisease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Furthermore, microtubules may\ncontain so-called defective regions where motor protein velocity is reduced due\nto accumulation of other motors and microtubule associated proteins. In this\nwork, we propose a new mathematical model describing the motion of motor\nproteins on microtubules which incorporate a defective region. We take a\nmean-field approach derived from a first principle lattice model to study motor\nprotein dynamics and density profiles. In particular, given a set of model\nparameters we obtain a closed-form expression for the equilibrium density\nprofile along a given microtubule. We then verify the analytic results using\nmathematical analysis on the discrete model and Monte Carlo simulations. This\nwork will contribute to the fundamental understanding of inhomogeneous\nmicrotubules providing insight into microscopic interactions that may result in\nthe onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Our results for inhomogeneous\nmicrotubules are consistent with prior work studying the homogeneous case.",

        "title": "Testing Mediation Effects Using Logic of Boolean Matrices",
        "summary": "Mediation analysis is becoming an increasingly important tool in scientific\nstudies. A central question in high-dimensional mediation analysis is to infer\nthe significance of individual mediators. The main challenge is the sheer\nnumber of possible paths that go through all combinations of mediators. Most\nexisting mediation inference solutions either explicitly impose that the\nmediators are conditionally independent given the exposure, or ignore any\npotential directed paths among the mediators. In this article, we propose a\nnovel hypothesis testing procedure to evaluate individual mediation effects,\nwhile taking into account potential interactions among the mediators. Our\nproposal thus fills a crucial gap, and greatly extends the scope of existing\nmediation tests. Our key idea is to construct the test statistic using the\nlogic of Boolean matrices, which enables us to establish the proper limiting\ndistribution under the null hypothesis. We further employ screening, data\nsplitting, and decorrelated estimation to reduce the bias and increase the\npower of the test. We show our test can control both the size and false\ndiscovery rate asymptotically, and the power of the test approaches one,\nmeanwhile allowing the number of mediators to diverge to infinity with the\nsample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through both simulations\nand a neuroimaging study of Alzheimer's disease.",

Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our method\nis comparable to other commonly used informative priors, while the\ninterpretation of UIP is intuitive and its implementation is relatively easy.\nOne distinctive feature of UIP is that its construction only requires summary\nstatistics commonly reported in the literature rather than the patient-level\ndata.

        "title": "Correlation in Neuronal Calcium Spiking: Quantification based on\n  Empirical Mutual Information Rate",
        "summary": "Quantification of neuronal correlations in neuron populations helps us to\nunderstand neural coding rules. Such quantification could also reveal how\nneurons encode information in normal and disease conditions like Alzheimer's\nand Parkinson's. While neurons communicate with each other by transmitting\nspikes, there would be a change in calcium concentration within the neurons\ninherently. Accordingly, there would be correlations in calcium spike trains\nand they could have heterogeneous memory structures. In this context,\nestimation of mutual information rate in calcium spike trains assumes primary\nsignificance. However, such estimation is difficult with available methods\nwhich would consider longer blocks for convergence without noticing that\nneuronal information changes in short time windows. Against this backdrop, we\npropose a faster method that exploits the memory structures in pair of calcium\nspike trains to quantify mutual information shared between them. Our method has\nshown superior performance with example Markov processes as well as\nexperimental spike trains. Such mutual information rate analysis could be used\nto identify signatures of neuronal behavior in large populations in normal and\nabnormal conditions.",

        "summary": "Data harmonization is the process by which an equivalence is developed\nbetween two variables measuring a common trait. Our problem is motivated by\ndementia research in which multiple tests are used in practice to measure the\nsame underlying cognitive ability such as language or memory. We connect this\nstatistical problem to mixing distribution estimation. We introduce and study a\nnon-parametric latent trait model, develop a method which enforces uniqueness\nof the regularized maximum likelihood estimator, show how a nonparametric EM\nalgorithm will converge weakly to its maximizer, and additionally propose a\nfaster algorithm for learning a discretized approximation of the latent\ndistribution. Furthermore, we develop methods to assess goodness of fit for the\nmixing likelihood which is an area neglected in most mixing distribution\nestimation problems. We apply our method to the National Alzheimer's\nCoordination Center Uniform Data Set and show that we can use our method to\nconvert between score measurements and account for the measurement error.

        "summary": "In this study, a longitudinal regression model for covariance matrix outcomes\nis introduced. The proposal considers a multilevel generalized linear model for\nregressing covariance matrices on (time-varying) predictors. This model\nsimultaneously identifies covariate associated components from covariance\nmatrices, estimates regression coefficients, and estimates the within-subject\nvariation in the covariance matrices. Optimal estimators are proposed for both\nlow-dimensional and high-dimensional cases by maximizing the (approximated)\nhierarchical likelihood function and are proved to be asymptotically\nconsistent, where the proposed estimator is the most efficient under the\nlow-dimensional case and achieves the uniformly minimum quadratic loss among\nall linear combinations of the identity matrix and the sample covariance matrix\nunder the high-dimensional case. Through extensive simulation studies, the\nproposed approach achieves good performance in identifying the covariate\nrelated components and estimating the model parameters. Applying to a\nlongitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the proposed approach identifies brain networks\nthat demonstrate the difference between males and females at different disease\nstages. The findings are in line with existing knowledge of AD and the method\nimproves the statistical power over the analysis of cross-sectional data.",

Deep hybrid models that marry the\npredictive power of neural networks with physical simulators such as\ndifferential equations, are starting to drive advances in such applications.\nThe task of modeling not just the observations but the hidden dynamics that are\ncaptured by the measurements poses interesting statistical/computational\nquestions. We propose a probabilistic model called ME-NODE to incorporate\n(fixed + random) mixed effects for analyzing such panel data. We show that our\nmodel can be derived using smooth approximations of SDEs provided by the\nWong-Zakai theorem. We then derive Evidence Based Lower Bounds for ME-NODE, and\ndevelop (efficient) training algorithms using MC based sampling methods and\nnumerical ODE solvers. We demonstrate ME-NODE's utility on tasks spanning the\nspectrum from simulations and toy data to real longitudinal 3D imaging data\nfrom an Alzheimer's disease (AD) study, and study its performance in terms of\naccuracy of reconstruction for interpolation, uncertainty estimates and\npersonalized prediction.",

Here, we examine a class\nof coupled chemical kinetics models of healthy and toxic proteins in two\nspatial dimensions. The anisotropic diffusion expected to take place within the\nbrain along axonal pathways is factored in the models and produces a\nfilamentary, predominantly one-dimensional transmission. Nevertheless, the\npotential of the anisotropic models towards generating interactions taking\nadvantage of the two-dimensional landscape is showcased. Finally, a reduction\nof the models into a simpler family of generalized\nFisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov (FKPP) type systems is examined.

        "summary": "There have been many attempts to identify high-dimensional network features\nvia multivariate approaches. Specifically, when the number of voxels or nodes,\ndenoted as p, are substantially larger than the number of images, denoted as n,\nit produces an under-determined model with infinitely many possible solutions.\nThe small-n large-p problem is often remedied by regularizing the\nunder-determined system with additional sparse penalties. Popular sparse\nnetwork models include sparse correlations, LASSO, sparse canonical\ncorrelations and graphical-LASSO. These popular sparse models require\noptimizing L1-norm penalties, which has been the major computational bottleneck\nfor solving large-scale problems. Thus, many existing sparse brain network\nmodels in brain imaging have been restricted to a few hundreds nodes or less.\n2527 MRI features used in a LASSO model for Alzheimer's disease is probably the\nlargest number of features used in any sparse model in the brain imaging\nliterature.",

        "summary": "Multimodal data are now prevailing in scientific research. A central question\nin multimodal integrative analysis is to understand how two data modalities\nassociate and interact with each other given another modality or demographic\nvariables. The problem can be formulated as studying the associations among\nthree sets of random variables, a question that has received relatively less\nattention in the literature. In this article, we propose a novel generalized\nliquid association analysis method, which offers a new and unique angle to this\nimportant class of problems of studying three-way associations. We extend the\nnotion of liquid association of \\citet{li2002LA} from the univariate setting to\nthe sparse, multivariate, and high-dimensional setting. We establish a\npopulation dimension reduction model, transform the problem to sparse Tucker\ndecomposition of a three-way tensor, and develop a higher-order orthogonal\niteration algorithm for parameter estimation. We derive the non-asymptotic\nerror bound and asymptotic consistency of the proposed estimator, while\nallowing the variable dimensions to be larger than and diverge with the sample\nsize. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method through both simulations and a\nmultimodal neuroimaging application for Alzheimer's disease research.",

To fill this gap, we develop a formal Bayesian\ntesting procedure which relies on the calculation of the Bayes factor between a\nstochastic block model with known grouping structure defined by the exogenous\nnode partition and an infinite relational model that allows the endogenous\nclustering configurations to be unknown, random and fully revealed by the\nblock-connectivity patterns in the network. A simple Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethod for computing the Bayes factor and quantifying uncertainty in the\nendogenous groups is proposed.

Recent\nworks using Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods have shown how a unified\npredictive uncertainty can be modelled for NNs. Decomposing this uncertainty to\ndisentangle the granular sources of heteroscedasticity in data provides rich\ninformation about its underlying causes. We propose a conceptually simple\nnon-Bayesian approach, deep split ensemble, to disentangle the predictive\nuncertainties using a multivariate Gaussian mixture model.

We\nevaluate our approach on a series of benchmark regression datasets, while also\ncomparing with unified uncertainty methods. Extensive analyses using dataset\nshits and empirical rule highlight our inherently well-calibrated models.

        "title": "Orthogonalized Kernel Debiased Machine Learning for Multimodal Data\n  Analysis",
        "summary": "Multimodal imaging has transformed neuroscience research. While it presents\nunprecedented opportunities, it also imposes serious challenges. Particularly,\nit is difficult to combine the merits of the interpretability attributed to a\nsimple association model with the flexibility achieved by a highly adaptive\nnonlinear model. In this article, we propose an orthogonalized kernel debiased\nmachine learning approach, which is built upon the Neyman orthogonality and a\nform of decomposition orthogonality, for multimodal data analysis. We target\nthe setting that naturally arises in almost all multimodal studies, where there\nis a primary modality of interest, plus additional auxiliary modalities. We\nestablish the root-$N$-consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated\nprimary parameter, the semi-parametric estimation efficiency, and the\nasymptotic validity of the confidence band of the predicted primary modality\neffect. Our proposal enjoys, to a good extent, both model interpretability and\nmodel flexibility. It is also considerably different from the existing\nstatistical methods for multimodal data integration, as well as the\northogonality-based methods for high-dimensional inferences. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our method through both simulations and an application to a\nmultimodal neuroimaging study of Alzheimer's disease.",
